    <font size="5">MAGICAL SKILLS<br>
    </font>
    <font size="3"><br>
        Magical skills are the ability to cast Spells. Here Spells work as any other skill, thus they don't have slots
        that limit them, but can be cast at will.
        Magical skills can be expressed in different way, and for this they can be associated with different abilities
        to be associated with spellcasting: <br><br>
        <B>Intelligence:</B> the study of the arcane arts or the training of the mind; <br>
        <B>Wisdom:</B> faith, spiritual connection or willpower; <br>
        <B>Charisma:</B> innate ability or some magic lineage; <br>
        <br>
        When your choose a magic skill for your character, you choose your spellcasting ability in a way that makes
        sense for how they learned it. If they did not study magic, and they don't have a spiritual connection to some
        god, entity or nature, they are probably channeling some innate ability.<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, Magical Skills require components to be cast: <br><br>
        <B>(V) Verbal:</B> you need to be able to speak arcane words; <br>
        <B>(S) Somatic:</B> you need your hands free to perform magical gestures; <br>
        <B>(M) Material:</B> you need some object or other material that is consumed during the casting of the spell;
        <br>
        <B>(F) Focus:</B> you need a tool through which you cast the spell but that is not consumed during the casting;
        <br>
    </font>
    <font size="5"><br>
        CASTING SPELLS<br>
    </font>
    <font size="3">Whether the result of training, faith, willpower or some innate ability, casting a spell works the
        same way.<br>
        <br>
        SKILL (S)<br>
        A spell's effectiveness is determined by your Skill in that specific spell. This functions like an attack bonus
        and represents your training and precision.<br><br>

        TIER (T)<br>
        Each spell has a Tier ranging from 0 to 9. This represents the spell's relative power and the XP cost required
        to learn or improve it.<br>
        To learn a spell of a given Tier, your spellcasting ability must be at least 10 + Tier.<br><br>

        MAGIC ATTACK<br>
        When you cast a spell that targets a creature's defenses, you make a Magic Attack roll:<br>
        1d20 + Skill + Spellcasting Ability Modifier<br>
        This is compared against the target's Defense Score (Reflexes, Fortitude, or Will).<br><br>

        SPELLCASTING FAILURE RULES<br>
        Casting a spell is an act of will, but channeling magical energy is dangerous for the unskilled. When you cast a
        spell, you must roll 1d20 and compare it to your Skill in that specific spell.<br>
        <br>
        <B>Success:</B> If the roll is less than or equal to your Skill, the spell takes effect normally.<br>
        <B>Failure:</B> If the roll is greater than your Skill, the spell fails. calculating the <B>Failure Margin</B>
        (Roll - Skill) determines the severity of the failure.<br>
        <br>
        <B>Failure Severity</B><br>

        <B>Effect Types & Consequences</B><br>
        Spells are categorized by their primary function. If a failure occurs, consult the appropriate column:<br>

                <td>Area manifests centered on the nearest valid point to the original target.</td>
                <td>You arrive at the nearest valid location to your intended destination (safe or unsafe).</td>
            </tr>

                <td><B>Backfire</B></td>
                <td>Spell affects the Caster. (Never causes instant death; take strongest non-lethal consequence).</td>
                <td>Area centers on the Caster.</td>
                <td>Partial movement causes injury or strain. Caster Stunned for 1d4 rounds.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        <B>Target Validity:</B> Misfire and Backfire effects always target legal entities/locations. If no legal
        target/location exists for a Misfire/Backfire, the result defaults to a Fizzle.<br>
        <br>
        CRITICAL FAILURE<br>
        If you roll a <B>Natural 20</B> on your casting roll, it is a <B>Critical Failure Threat</B>. The spell resolves
        normally (it does not fail yet), but you must immediately roll another 1d20.<br>
        &#149; If the second roll is > Spell Skill: You are <B>Stunned</B> for 1d4 rounds after the spell resolves.<br>
        &#149; If the second roll is <B>also a Natural 20</B>: You <B>Black Out</B> (fall Unconscious). The spell ends
        immediately/does not resolve.<br>
        <br>
        CONCENTRATION<br>
        Spells with a duration of "Concentration" require you to maintain focus. If you take damage or are otherwise
        distracted while maintaining a spell, you must make a specialized check (usually Will or Constitution, DC 10 +
        damage taken or distraction magnitude) or lose the spell. Because casting is now instant "at will" for the
        purpose of the roll, you generally do check for interruption during the casting action itself unless the casting
        time is 1 round or longer.<br>
        <br>
        <B>Environmental Modifiers:</B><br>
        Severe weather or motion can apply penalties to your Spell Skill before you roll, increasing the chance of
        failure.<br>
        &#149; Vigorous motion: -5 Skill<br>
        &#149; Violent motion: -10 Skill<br>
        &#149; Grappled/Entangled: -15 Skill<br>
        <br>

        You may combine these effects: take all relevant penalties and subtract them from your base Skill to determine
        your effective Skill for the casting roll.<br>
        <br>
        COUNTERSPELLS<br>
        It is possible to cast any spell as a counterspell. By doing so, you are using the spell's energy to disrupt the
        casting of the same spell by another character.<br>
        <B>How Counterspells Work: </B>To use a counterspell, you must select an opponent as the target of the
        counterspell. You do this by choosing the ready action. In doing so, you elect to wait to complete your action
        until your opponent tries to cast a spell.<br>
        If the target of your counterspell tries to cast a spell, make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell's level).
        This check is a free action. If the check succeeds, you correctly identify the opponent's spell and can attempt
        to counter it. If the check fails, you can't do either of these things.<br>
        To complete the action, you must then cast the correct spell. As a general rule, a spell can only counter
        itself. If you are able to cast the same spell, you cast it, altering it slightly to create a counterspell
        effect. If the target is within range, both spells automatically negate each other with no other results.<br>
        <B>Specific Exceptions:</B> Some spells specifically counter each other, especially when they have diametrically
        opposed effects.<br>
        <B><I>Dispel Magic </I>as a Counterspell:</B> You can use <I>dispel magic </I>to counterspell another
        spellcaster, and you don't need to identify the spell he or she is casting. However, <I>dispel magic </I>doesn't
        always work as a counterspell (see the spell description).<br>
        <br>
        COMBINING MAGICAL EFFECTS<br>
        Spells or magical effects usually work as described, no matter how many other spells or magical effects happen
        to be operating in the same area or on the same recipient. Except in special cases, a spell does not affect the
        way another spell operates. Whenever a spell has a specific effect on other spells, the spell description
        explains that effect. Several other general rules apply when spells or magical effects operate in the same
        place:<br>
        <B>Stacking Effects:</B> Spells that provide bonuses or penalties on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws,
        and other attributes usually do not stack with themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type don't
        stack even if they come from different spells (or from effects other than spells; see Bonus Types, above). <br>
        <I>Different Bonus Names: </I>The bonuses or penalties from two different spells stack if the modifiers are of
        different types. A bonus that isn't named stacks with any bonus.<br>
        <I>Same Effect More than Once in Different Strengths: </I>In cases when two or more identical spells are
        operating in the same area or on the same target, but at different strengths, only the best one applies.<br>
        <I>Same Effect with Differing Results: </I>The same spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied to
        the same recipient more than once. Usually the last spell in the series trumps the others. None of the previous
        spells are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell in the
        series lasts.<br>
        <I>One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant: </I>Sometimes, one spell can render a later spell irrelevant. Both
        spells are still active, but one has rendered the other useless in some fashion.<br>
        <I>Multiple Mental Control Effects: </I>Sometimes magical effects that establish mental control render each
        other irrelevant, such as a spell that removes the subjects ability to act. Mental controls that don't remove
        the recipient's ability to act usually do not interfere with each other. If a creature is under the mental
        control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the
        control each effect allows. If the controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing
        controllers must make opposed Charisma checks to determine which one the creature obeys.<br>
        <B>Spells with Opposite Effects:</B> Spells with opposite effects apply normally, with all bonuses, penalties,
        or changes accruing in the order that they apply. Some spells negate or counter each other. This is a special
        effect that is noted in a spell's description. <br>
        <B>Instantaneous Effects:</B> Two or more spells with instantaneous durations work cumulatively when they affect
        the same target.<br>
        SPELL SCHOOL (SUBSCHOOL)<br>
        Beneath the spell name is a line giving the school of magic (and the subschool, if appropriate) that the spell
        belongs to.<br>
        Almost every spell belongs to one of eight schools of magic. A school of magic is a group of related spells that
        work in similar ways. A small number of spells (<I>arcane mark, limited wish, permanency, prestidigitation,
        </I>and <I>wish</I>) are universal, belonging to no school.<br>
        <br>
        <B>Abjuration<br>
        </B>Abjurations are protective spells. They create physical or magical barriers, negate magical or physical
        abilities, harm trespassers, or even banish the subject of the spell to another plane of existence. <I><br>
        </I>If one abjuration spell is active within 10 feet of another for 24 hours or more, the magical fields
        interfere with each other and create barely visible energy fluctuations. The DC to find such spells with the
        Search skill drops by 4.<br>
        If an abjuration creates a barrier that keeps certain types of creatures at bay, that barrier cannot be used to
        push away those creatures. If you force the barrier against such a creature, you feel a discernible pressure
        against the barrier. If you continue to apply pressure, you end the spell.<br>
        <br>
        <B>Conjuration<br>
        </B>Each conjuration spell belongs to one of five subschools. Conjurations bring manifestations of objects,
        creatures, or some form of energy to you (the summoning subschool), actually transport creatures from another
        plane of existence to your plane (calling), heal (healing), transport creatures or objects over great distances
        (teleportation), or create objects or effects on the spot (creation). Creatures you conjure usually, but not
        always, obey your commands.<br>
        A creature or object brought into being or transported to your location by a conjuration spell cannot appear
        inside another creature or object, nor can it appear floating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open
        location on a surface capable of supporting it.<br>
        The creature or object must appear within the spell's range, but it does not have to remain within the
        range.<br>
        <B>Calling:</B> A calling spell transports a creature from another plane to the plane you are on. The spell
        grants the creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin, although the spell may limit the
        circumstances under which this is possible. Creatures who are called actually die when they are killed; they do
        not disappear and reform, as do those brought by a summoning spell (see below). The duration of a calling spell
        is instantaneous, which means that the called creature can't be dispelled.<br>
        <B>Creation: </B>A creation spell manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place the
        spellcaster designates (subject to the limits noted above). If the spell has a duration other than
        instantaneous, magic holds the creation together, and when the spell ends, the conjured creature or object
        vanishes without a trace. If the spell has an instantaneous duration, the created object or creature is merely
        assembled through magic. It lasts indefinitely and does not depend on magic for its existence.<br>
        <B>Healing: </B>Certain divine conjurations heal creatures or even bring them back to life.<br>
        <B>Summoning:</B> A summoning spell instantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate. When the
        spell ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came from, but a summoned
        object is not sent back unless the spell description specifically indicates this. A summoned creature also goes
        away if it is killed or if its hit points drop to 0 or lower. It is not really dead. It takes 24 hours for the
        creature to reform, during which time it can't be summoned again.<br>
        When the spell that summoned a creature ends and the creature disappears, all the spells it has cast expire. A
        summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning abilities it may have, and it refuses to cast any spells that
        would cost it XP, or to use any spell-like abilities that would cost XP if they were spells.<br>
        <B>Teleportation:</B> A teleportation spell transports one or more creatures or objects a great distance. The
        most powerful of these spells can cross planar boundaries. Unlike summoning spells, the transportation is
        (unless otherwise noted) one-way and not dispellable.<br>
        Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks
        teleportation.<br>
        <br>
        <B>Divination<br>
        </B>Divination spells enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to predict the future, to find hidden things,
        and to foil deceptive spells.<I><br>
        </I>Many divination spells have cone-shaped areas. These move with you and extend in the direction you look. The
        cone defines the area that you can sweep each round. If you study the same area for multiple rounds, you can
        often gain additional information, as noted in the descriptive text for the spell.<br>
        <B>Scrying:</B> A scrying spell creates an invisible magical sensor that sends you information. Unless noted
        otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This level of acuity includes any
        spells or effects that target you, but not spells or effects that emanate from you. However, the sensor is
        treated as a separate, independent sensory organ of yours, and thus it functions normally even if you have been
        blinded, deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment.<br>
        Any creature with an Intelligence score of 12 or higher can notice the sensor by making a DC 20 Intelligence
        check. The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an active spell.<br>
        Lead sheeting or magical protection blocks a scrying spell, and you sense that the spell is so blocked.<br>
        <br>
        <B>Enchantment<br>
        </B>Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior.<I><br>
        </I>All enchantments are mind-affecting spells. Two types of enchantment spells grant you influence over a
        subject creature.<br>
        <B>Charm:</B> A charm spell changes how the subject views you, typically making it see you as a good friend.<br>
        <B>Compulsion:</B> A compulsion spell forces the subject to act in some manner or changes the way her mind
        works. Some compulsion spells determine the subject's actions or the effects on the subject, some compulsion
        spells allow you to determine the subject's actions when you cast the spell, and others give you ongoing control
        over the subject.<br>
        <br>
        <B>Evocation<br>
        </B>Evocation spells manipulate energy or tap an unseen source of power to produce a desired end. In effect,
        they create something out of nothing. Many of these spells produce spectacular effects, and evocation spells can
        deal large amounts of damage.<I><br>
        </I><br>
        <B>Illusion<br>
        </B>Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there,
        not see things that are there, hear phantom noises, or remember things that never happened.<br>
        <B>Figment:</B> A figment spell creates a false sensation. Those who perceive the figment perceive the same
        thing, not their own slightly different versions of the figment. (It is not a personalized mental impression.)
        Figments cannot make something seem to be something else. A figment that includes audible effects cannot
        duplicate intelligible speech unless the spell description specifically says it can. If intelligible speech is
        possible, it must be in a language you can speak. If you try to duplicate a language you cannot speak, the image
        produces gibberish. Likewise, you cannot make a visual copy of something unless you know what it looks like.<br>
        Because figments and glamers (see below) are unreal, they cannot produce real effects the way that other types
        of illusions can. They cannot cause damage to objects or creatures, support weight, provide nutrition, or
        provide protection from the elements. Consequently, these spells are useful for confounding or delaying foes,
        but useless for attacking them directly. <br>
        A figment's AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier.<br>
        <B>Glamer:</B> A glamer spell changes a subject's sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or
        sound like something else, or even seem to disappear.<br>
        <B>Pattern:</B> Like a figment, a pattern spell creates an image that others can see, but a pattern also affects
        the minds of those who see it or are caught in it. All patterns are mind-affecting spells.<br>
        <B>Phantasm: </B>A phantasm spell creates a mental image that usually only the caster and the subject (or
        subjects) of the spell can perceive. This impression is totally in the minds of the subjects. It is a
        personalized mental impression. (It's all in their heads and not a fake picture or something that they actually
        see.) Third parties viewing or studying the scene don't notice the phantasm. All phantasms are mind-affecting
        spells.<br>
        <B>Shadow:</B> A shadow spell creates something that is partially real from extradimensional energy. Such
        illusions can have real effects. Damage dealt by a shadow illusion is real.<br>
        <B>Saving Throws and Illusions (Disbelief ): </B>Creatures encountering an illusion usually do not receive
        saving throws to recognize it as illusory until they study it carefully or interact with it in some fashion.<br>
        A successful saving throw against an illusion reveals it to be false, but a figment or phantasm remains as a
        translucent outline.<br>
        A failed saving throw indicates that a character fails to notice something is amiss. A character faced with
        proof that an illusion isn't real needs no saving throw. If any viewer successfully disbelieves an illusion and
        communicates this fact to others, each such viewer gains a saving throw with a +4 bonus.<br>
        <br>
        <B>Necromancy<br>
        </B>Necromancy spells manipulate the power of death, unlife, and the life force. Spells involving undead
        creatures make up a large part of this school. <br>
        <B><br>
            Transmutation<br>
        </B>Transmutation spells change the properties of some creature, thing, or condition. <br>
        <br>
        [DESCRIPTOR]<br>
        Appearing on the same line as the school and subschool, when applicable, is a descriptor that further
        categorizes the spell in some way. Some spells have more than one descriptor.<br>
        The descriptors are acid, air, chaotic, cold, darkness, death, earth, electricity, evil, fear, fire, force,
        good, language-dependent, lawful, light, mind-affecting, sonic, and water.<br>
        Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the spell interacts with other
        spells, with special abilities, with unusual creatures, with alignment, and so on.<br>
        A language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for communication. If the target cannot
        understand or cannot hear what the caster of a language-dependant spell says the spell fails.<br>
        A mind-affecting spell works only against creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or higher.<br>
        <br>
        CASTING TIME<br>
        Most spells have a casting time of 1 action. Others take 1 round or more, while a few require only a reaction or
        even a free action.<br>
        A spell that takes 1 round to cast comes into effect just before the beginning of your turn in the round after
        you began casting the spell. You then act normally after the spell is completed.<br>
        A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each of
        those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a full-round action, just as noted above for 1- round casting
        times). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails.<br>
        When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue the concentration from the
        current round to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose concentration before the
        casting is complete, you lose the spell.<br>
        A spell with a casting time of 1 free action doesn't count against your normal limit of one spell per round.
        However, you may cast such a spell only once per round.
        You make all pertinent decisions about a spell (range, target, area, effect, version, and so forth) when the
        spell comes into effect.<br>
        <br>
        RANGE<br>
        A spell's range indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in the Range entry of the spell description.
        A spell's range is the maximum distance from you that the spell's effect can occur, as well as the maximum
        distance at which you can designate the spell's point of origin. If any portion of the spell's area would extend
        beyond this range, that area is wasted. Standard ranges include the following.<br>
        <B>Personal:</B> The spell affects only you.<br>
        <B>Touch:</B> You must touch a creature or object to affect it. A touch spell that deals damage can score a
        critical hit just as a weapon can. A touch spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals
        double damage on a successful critical hit. Some touch spells allow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch
        as many willing targets as you can reach as part of the casting, but all targets of the spell must be touched in
        the same round that you finish casting the spell.<br>
        <B>Very Close:</B> Less than 20 feet.<br>
        <B>Close:</B> Less than 40 feet.<br>
        <B>Far:</B> Less than 60 feet.<br>
        <B>Very Far:</B> More than 60 feet.<br>
        <B>Unlimited:</B> The spell reaches anywhere on the same plane of existence.<br>
        <br>
        AIMING A SPELL<br>
        You must make some choice about whom the spell is to affect or where the effect is to originate, depending on
        the type of spell. The next entry in a spell description defines the spell's target (or targets), its effect, or
        its area, as appropriate.<br>
        <B>Target or Targets:</B> Some spells<I> </I>have a target or targets. You cast these spells on creatures or
        objects, as defined by the spell itself. You must be able to see or touch the target, and you must specifically
        choose that target. You do not have to select your target until you finish casting the spell.<br>
        If the target of a spell is yourself (the spell description has a line that reads Target: You), you do not
        receive a saving throw, and spell resistance does not apply. The Saving Throw and Spell Resistance lines are
        omitted from such spells.<br>
        Some spells restrict you to willing targets only. Declaring yourself as a willing target is something that can
        be done at any time (even if you're flat-footed or it isn't your turn). Unconscious creatures are automatically
        considered willing, but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who is bound,
        cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically willing.<br>
        Some spells allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you cast the spell. Redirecting a
        spell is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.<br>
        <B>Effect:</B> Some spells create or summon things rather than affecting things that are already present.<br>
        You must designate the location where these things are to appear, either by seeing it or defining it. Range
        determines how far away an effect can appear, but if the effect is mobile it can move regardless of the spell's
        range.<br>
        <I>Ray: </I>Some effects are rays. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you make a ranged
        touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an
        invisible creature and hope you hit something. You don't have to see the creature you're trying to hit, as you
        do with a targeted spell. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of sight or provide
        cover for the creature you're aiming at.<br>
        If a ray spell has a duration, it's the duration of the effect that the ray causes, not the length of time the
        ray itself persists.<br>
        If a ray spell deals damage, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a weapon. A ray spell threatens a
        critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit.<br>
        <I>Spread: </I>Some effects, notably clouds and fogs, spread out from a point of origin, which must be a grid
        intersection. The effect can extend around corners and into areas that you can't see. Figure distance by actual
        distance traveled, taking into account turns the spell effect takes. When determining distance for spread
        effects, count around walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace diagonals across corners. You must
        designate the point of origin for such an effect, but you need not have line of effect (see below) to all
        portions of the effect.<br>
        <B>Area:</B> Some spells affect an area. Sometimes a spell description specifies a specially defined area, but
        usually an area falls into one of the categories defined below.<br>
        Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point where the spell originates, but otherwise you don't
        control which creatures or objects the spell affects. The point of origin of a spell is always a grid
        intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within the area of a spell, count out the distance
        from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when determining the range for a
        ranged attack. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to the center of
        the next, you count from intersection to intersection.<br>
        You can count diagonally across a square, but remember that every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of
        distance. If the far edge of a square is within the spell's area, anything within that square is within the
        spell's area. If the spell's area only touches the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square
        is unaffected by the spell.<br>
        <I>Burst, Emanation, or Spread: </I>Most spells that affect an area function as a burst, an emanation, or a
        spread. In each case, you select the spell's point of origin and measure its effect from that point.<br>
        A burst spell affects whatever it catches in its area, even including creatures that you can't see. It can't
        affect creatures with total cover from its point of origin (in other words, its effects don't extend around
        corners). The default shape for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst spells are specifically described as
        cone-shaped. A burst's area defines how far from the point of origin the spell's effect extends.<I><br>
        </I>An emanation spell functions like a burst spell, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point
        of origin for the duration of the spell. Most emanations are cones or spheres.<I><br>
        </I>A spread spell spreads out like a burst but can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the spell
        spreads out a given distance in all directions. Figure the area the spell effect fills by taking into account
        any turns the spell effect takes.<I><br>
            Cone, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere: </I>Most spells that affect an area have a particular shape, such as a
        cone, cylinder, line, or sphere.<br>
        A cone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts from any
        corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either bursts or emanations (see above), and
        thus won't go around corners.<I><br>
        </I>When casting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the spell's point of origin. This point is the center of a
        horizontal circle, and the spell shoots down from the circle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped spell
        ignores any obstructions within its area.<I><br>
        </I>A line-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner
        of your square and extends to the limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect. A
        line-shaped spell affects all creatures in squares that the line passes through.<I><br>
        </I>A sphere-shaped spell expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres may be bursts,
        emanations, or spreads.<I><br>
            Creatures: </I>A spell with this kind of area affects creatures directly (like a targeted spell), but it
        affects all creatures in an area of some kind rather than individual creatures you select. The area might be a
        spherical burst , a cone-shaped burst, or some other shape.<br>
        Many spells affect &#147;living creatures,&#148; which means all creatures other than constructs and undead.
        Creatures in the spell's area that are not of the appropriate type do not count against the creatures
        affected.<br>
        <I>Objects: </I>A spell with this kind of area affects objects within an area you select (as Creatures, but
        affecting objects instead).<br>
        <I>Other: </I>A spell can have a unique area, as defined in its description.<br>
        <I>(S) Shapeable: </I>If an Area or Effect entry ends with &#147;(S),&#148; you can shape the spell. A shaped
        effect or area can have no dimension smaller than 10 feet. Many effects or areas are given as cubes to make it
        easy to model irregular shapes. Three-dimensional volumes are most often needed to define aerial or underwater
        effects and areas.<br>
        <B>Line of Effect:</B> A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a spell can affect. A
        line of effect is canceled by a solid barrier. It's like line of sight for ranged weapons, except that it's not
        blocked by fog, darkness, and other factors that limit normal sight.<br>
        You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you cast a spell on or to any space in which you wish to
        create an effect. You must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any spell you cast<I>.<br>
        </I>A burst, cone, cylinder, or emanation spell affects only an area, creatures, or objects to which it has line
        of effect from its origin (a spherical burst's center point, a cone-shaped burst's starting point, a cylinder's
        circle, or an emanation's point of origin).<br>
        An otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does not block a spell's line of
        effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length of wall containing the hole is no longer considered a
        barrier for purposes of a spell's line of effect.<br>
        <br>
        DURATION<br>
        A spell's Duration entry tells you how long the magical energy of the spell lasts.<br>
        <B>Timed Durations: </B>Many durations are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other increment. When the
        time is up, the magic goes away and the spell ends. If a spell's duration is variable the duration is rolled
        secretly (the caster doesn't know how long the spell will last). <br>
        <B>Instantaneous:</B> The spell energy comes and goes the instant the spell is cast, though the consequences
        might be long-lasting.<br>
        <B>Permanent: </B>The energy remains as long as the effect does. This means the spell is vulnerable to <I>dispel
            magic</I>. <I><br>
        </I><B>Concentration:</B> The spell lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a spell is
        a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Anything that could break your concentration
        when casting a spell can also break your concentration while you're maintaining one, causing the spell to
        end.<br>
        You can't cast a spell while concentrating on another one. Sometimes a spell lasts for a short time after you
        cease concentrating.<br>
        <B>Subjects, Effects, and Areas:</B> If the spell affects creatures directly the result travels with the
        subjects for the spell's duration. If the spell creates an effect, the effect lasts for the duration. The effect
        might move or remain still. Such an effect can be destroyed prior to when its duration ends. If the spell
        affects an area then the spell stays with that area for its duration. <br>
        Creatures become subject to the spell when they enter the area and are no longer subject to it when they
        leave.<br>
        <B>Touch Spells and Holding the Charge:</B> In most cases, if you don't discharge a touch spell on the round you
        cast it, you can hold the charge (postpone the discharge of the spell) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks
        round after round. If you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.<br>
        Some touch spells<I> </I>allow you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell. You can't hold the charge of
        such a spell; you must touch all targets of the spell in the same round that you finish casting the spell.<br>
        <B>Discharge:</B> Occasionally a spells lasts for a set duration or until triggered or discharged.<br>
        <B>(D) Dismissible:</B> If the Duration line ends with &#147;(D),&#148; you can dismiss the spell at will. You
        must be within range of the spell's effect and must speak words of dismissal, which are usually a modified form
        of the spell's verbal component. If the spell has no verbal component, you can dismiss the effect with a
        gesture. Dismissing a spell is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.<br>
        A spell that depends on concentration is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not take an
        action, since all you have to do to end the spell is to stop concentrating on your turn.<br>
        <br>
        SAVING THROW<br>
        Usually a harmful spell allows a target to make a saving throw to avoid some or all of the effect. The Saving
        Throw entry in a spell description defines which type of saving throw the spell allows and describes how saving
        throws against the spell work.<br>
        <B>Negates: </B>The spell has no effect on a subject that makes a successful saving throw.<br>
        <B>Partial:</B> The spell causes an effect on its subject. A successful saving throw means that some lesser
        effect occurs.<br>
        <B>Half:</B> The spell deals damage, and a successful saving throw halves the damage taken (round down).<br>
        <B>None:</B> No saving throw is allowed.<br>
        <B>Disbelief:</B> A successful save lets the subject ignore the effect. <br>
        <B>(object):</B> The spell can be cast on objects, which receive saving throws only if they are magical or if
        they are attended (held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the spell, in which case the object
        uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own bonus is greater. (This notation does not mean that a
        spell can be cast only on objects. Some spells of this sort can be cast on creatures or objects.) A magic item's
        saving throw bonuses are each equal to 2 + one-half the item's level. <br>
        <B>(harmless):</B> The spell is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a saving
        throw if it desires.<br>
        <B>Saving Throw Difficulty Class:</B> A saving throw against your spell has a DC of 10 + the level of the spell
        + your bonus for the relevant ability (Intelligence for a wizard, Charisma for a sorcerer or bard, or Wisdom for
        a cleric, druid, paladin, or ranger). A spell's level can vary depending on your class. Always use the spell
        level applicable to your class.<br>
        <B>Succeeding on a Saving Throw: </B>A creature that successfully saves against a spell that has no obvious
        physical effects feels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot deduce the exact nature of the attack. Likewise,
        if a creature's saving throw succeeds against a targeted spell you sense that the spell has failed. You do not
        sense when creatures succeed on saves against effect and area spells.<br>
        <B>Automatic Failures and Successes:</B> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure,
        and the spell may cause damage to exposed items (see Items Surviving after a Saving Throw, below). A natural 20
        (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.<br>
        <B>Voluntarily Giving up a Saving Throw:</B> A creature can voluntarily forego a saving throw and willingly
        accept a spell's result. Even a character with a special resistance to magic can suppress this quality.<br>
        <B>Items Surviving after a Saving Throw:</B> Unless the descriptive text for the spell specifies otherwise, all
        items carried or worn by a creature are assumed to survive a magical attack. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on
        its saving throw against the effect, however, an exposed item is harmed (if the attack can harm objects). Refer
        to Table: Items Affected by Magical Attacks. Determine which four objects carried or worn by the creature are
        most likely to be affected and roll randomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a saving throw
        against the attack form and take whatever damage the attack deal.<br>
        If an item is not carried or worn and is not magical, it does not get a saving throw. It simply is dealt the
        appropriate damage.<br>

    <font size="3"><br>
        SPELL RESISTANCE<br>
        Magical Resistance is a trait that protects a creature from being affected by magic. When a spell is cast, if
        the caster's spellcasting roll is lower than the creature's Magical Resistance threshold, the spell has no
        effect on that creature.<br>
        This applies regardless of whether the spell targets a Defence, affects an area, or is otherwise
        non-discriminating. Harmless spells can still be accepted voluntarily by the resistant creature.<br>
        By default, all spells are subject to Magical Resistance. A creature with Magical Resistance is unaffected by a
        spell if the caster's spellcasting roll is below the resistance threshold.<br>
        Some spells may ignore Magical Resistance entirely. These exceptions are noted explicitly in the spell
        description.<br><br>

        <br>
        CASTING AT HIGEHR LEVEL<br>
        You can cast a spell you know at a higher Spell Level, but your Skill is reduced by -4 for each Spell Level
        above the original spell level. This means that you can cast a spell at a higher Spell Level, but you are less
        likely to succeed, increasing the risk of Failure Severity. When you increase the Level of a Spell, it counts as
        the new level for all purposes.<br>
        Instead of increasing the Spell Level, you could create the following metamagic effect depending on the
        increased level: <br>
        <B>(+2) Empowered:</B> All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by one-half; <br>
        <B>(+1) Enlarged:</B> The range of the spell is doubled if defined as close, medium or long; <br>
        <B>(+1) Extended:</B> The duration of the spell is doubled; <br>
        <B>(+3) Maximized:</B> All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are maximised; <br>
        <B>(+4) Quickened:</B> A quickened spell is cast as a bonus; You can only quicken one spell per round, and only
        spells with duration shorter than 1 round; <br>
        <B>(+1) Silent:</B> You don't need to provide verbal component; <br>
        <B>(+1) Still:</B> You don't need to provide somatic component; <br>
        <B>(+3) Widened:</B> Any numeric measurement of the spell's area is doubled; <br>
        <br>
        To be able to cast a Spell at a higher level, you need to have a Skill high enough such that the modified Skill
        is not below 0. For example, you cannot cast a quickened spell if your Skill in that Spell is not at least 16.

        SYNERGY
        <br> Magic skills interact and synergize with each other in the following way:<br>
        &#149; For every two Skills above 5 in a given school, you gain a +1 bonus to all other Skills in that
        school.<br>
        &#149; For every three Skills above 5 that share a keyword (like <i>fire</i>, <i>cold</i>, or <i>evil</i>), you
        gain a +1 bonus to all other Skills with that keyword.<br>
        The bonus becomes +2 if the Skills are above 10, and +3 if they are above 15. <br>

            LEARNING MAGIC<br>
        </font>
        <font size="3">
            Learning new Magical Skills requires a Mentor or deep understanding of how Magic works (i.e. Spellcraft
            skill), while improving Magical Skills you already know just needs practice. <br><br>
            IMPROVING MAGICAL SKILLS<br>
            To improve a Magical Skill you already know, you just need to spend the appropriate number of Experience
            Rolls like any other skills. <br>
            Since you can cast a spell at a higher Spell Level, if casting it at a higher Spell Level changes the spell
            in any way, you can decide to progress that specific skill (the higher level spell) without having to start
            from scratch. This does not have any impact on the lower level spell, unless the skill in the higher level
            spell becomes higher than the skill in the lower level spell. In that case, for the lower level spell you
            can use the skill of the higher level spell.<br><br>
            Whenever you succesfully improve your magical skill, you roll 1d4 to establish by what margin your skill
            improves.

            LEARNING NEW MAGIC<br>
            Learning new Magic requires time and dedication, but especially some source of truth. It is possible to
            learn magic my one self, but much harder. Here are a few possibilities. <br>
            <B>From a book or a scroll:</B> Spellcraft check with DC 15 + Spell level; it requires 8 hours and you
            cannot retry for that spell until your Spellcraft skill improves.
            <br>
            <B>From a mentor:</B> It requires 1 hour per Spell Level. The mentor might require money or some sort of
            service in exchange for this knowledge.
            <br>
            <B>From having seen it:</B> Spellcraft check with DC 20 + Spell level; it requires 1 hour per Spell Level
            and you cannot retry for that spell until your Spellcraft skill improves and you see it again.
            <br>
            <B>Independent Research:</B> You can try to learn a spell you have never seen or heard of. Spellcraft check
            with DC 25 + Spell level; it requires 1 week per Spell Level and you cannot retry for that spell until your
            Spellcraft skill improves.
            <br>
            In all circumstances, you need the appropriate ability score to be able to learn a spell, i.e. your ability
            score - 10 must be at least the same of the Spell Level you are trying to.
            Also, if you have synergies with the spell you are trying to learn, you can add those synergies to your
            Spellcraft check.
