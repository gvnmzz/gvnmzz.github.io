    </font>
    <font size="3"><br>
        This page lists special abilities and skills unique to monsters, formatted similarly to character skills.
        <br><br>
        <B>(&#9210;&#9210;) Aura of Menace (Cha):</B> A righteous aura surrounds the creature. Hostile creatures within
        a 20-foot radius must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha mod) or take a -2 penalty on attacks, AC, and
        saves for 24 hours or until they hit the creature. A creature that saves is immune for 24 hours.
        <br><br>
        <B>(&#9210;&#9210;) Babble (Cha):</B> The creature constantly mutters and whines, creating a hypnotic effect.
        Sane creatures within 60 feet must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha mod) or be affected as though by
        a <I>hypnotism</I> spell for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion.
        <br><br>
        <B>(&#9210;&#9210;) Black Cloud (Con):</B> Up to three times per day, the creature can release a choking, toxic
        black cloud. Those within 10 feet take 2d6 damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Con
        mod) or be affected for 3 hours as though by an <I>insanity</I> spell.
        <br><br>
        <B>(&#9210;) Camouflage (Ex):</B> The creature looks like a normal plant or object when at rest. It takes a DC
        20 Spot check to notice it before it attacks.
        <br><br>
        <B>(&#9210;&#9210;) Change Shape (Su):</B> The creature can assume the form of a specific humanoid or animal. It
        retains its own stats but gains the natural weapons and movement modes of the new form.
        <br><br>
        <B>(&#9210;) Constrict (Str):</B> The creature deals damage equal to its slam/tentacle damage plus Strength
        bonus with a successful grapple check.
        <br><br>
        <B>(&#9210;&#9210;) Electricity Ray (Su):</B> The creature can fire a ray of electricity once per round with a
        range of 50 feet. It requires a ranged touch attack.
        <br><br>
        <p><b>Dominate Person (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;):</b> You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through
            a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind. If you and the subject have a common language,
            you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no
            common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight,"
            and "Stand still." You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input
            from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command,
            it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those
            necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Changing your instructions or
            giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
        </p>
