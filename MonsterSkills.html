        MONSTER SKILLS<br>
    </font>
    <font size="3"><br>
        This page lists special abilities and skills unique to monsters, formatted similarly to character skills.
        <br><br>
        <B>Alternate Form (Su):</B> The creature can shift between its humanoid and whirlwind forms as a standard
        action.
        <br><br>
        <B>Aura of Menace (Cha):</B> A righteous aura surrounds the creature. Hostile creatures within a 20-foot radius
        must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha mod) or take a -2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24
        hours or until they hit the creature. A creature that saves is immune for 24 hours.
        <br><br>
        <B>Babble (Cha):</B> The creature constantly mutters and whines, creating a hypnotic effect. Sane creatures
        within 60 feet must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha mod) or be affected as though by a
        <I>hypnotism</I> spell for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion.
        <br><br>
        <B>Barbed Defense (Su):</B> Any creature striking the creature with handheld weapons or natural weapons takes
        1d8+6 points of piercing and slashing damage from the creature's barbs. Note that weapons with exceptional
        reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way.
        <br><br>
        <B>Black Cloud (Con):</B> Up to three times per day, the creature can release a choking, toxic black cloud.
        Those
        within 10 feet take 2d6 damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Con mod) or be affected
        for 3 hours as though by an <I>insanity</I> spell.
        <br><br>
        <B>Blink (Su):</B> The creature can use <I>blink</I> as the spell, and can evoke or end the
        effect as a free action.
        <br><br>
        <B>Breath Weapon (Su):</B> The creature breathes a cone or line of energy (fire, acid, electricity, etc.).
        Reflex
        save for half damage.
        <br><br>
        <B>Camouflage (Ex):</B> The creature looks like a normal plant or object when at rest. It takes a DC 20 Spot
        check to notice it before it attacks.
        <br><br>
        <B>Change Shape (Su):</B> The creature can assume the form of a specific humanoid or animal. It retains its own
        stats but gains the natural weapons and movement modes of the new form.
        <br><br>
        <B>Constrict (Str):</B> The creature deals damage equal to its slam/tentacle damage plus Strength bonus with a
        successful grapple check.
        <br><br>
        <B>Corporeal Instability (Su):</B> A blow from the creature causes a terrible transformation. Fortitude save (DC
        10 + 1/2 HD + Con mod) or become a spongy, amorphous mass. Wisdom drain applies.
        <br><br>
        <B>Corrosive Slime (Ex):</B> The creature produces a mucuslike slime that contains a highly corrosive substance.
        The slime is particularly effective against stone. The creature's mere touch deals 2d6 points of acid damage to
        organic creatures or objects. Against metallic creatures or objects, the slime deals 4d8 points of damage, and
        against stony creatures (including earth elementals) or objects it deals 8d10 points of damage. A slam attack by
        the creature leaves a patch of slime that deals 2d6 points of damage on contact and another 2d6 points of damage
        in each of the next 2 rounds. A large quantity (at least a quart) of water or weak acid, such as vinegar, washes
        off the slime. An opponent's armor and clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless the wearer
        succeeds on a Reflex save. Weapons that strike the creature also dissolve immediately unless the wielder
        succeeds on a Reflex save. A creature attacking with natural weapons takes damage from its slime each time an
        attack hits unless the creature succeeds on a Reflex save.
        <br><br>
        <B>Death Gaze (Su):</B> Death, range 30 feet, Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha mod) negates.
        <br><br>
        <B>Destructive Harmonics (Su):</B> The creature can blast sonic energy in a cone up to 80 feet long. It can also
        use this attack to affect any creatures or objects within a 30-foot radius. It can tune the harmonics of this
        destructive power to affect different types of targets. Flesh: Disrupting tissue and rending bone, this attack
        deals 4d6 points of damage to all within the area (Reflex half). Nerves: The creature can focus its harmonics to
        knock out foes rather than slay them. This attack deals 6d6 points of nonlethal damage to all within the area
        (Reflex half). Material: When using this form of harmonics, the creature chooses wood, stone, metal, or glass.
        All objects made of that material within the area must succeed on a Fortitude save or shatter. Objects (or
        portions of objects) that have up to 30 hit points are potentially affected by this attack.
        <br><br>
        <B>Dimension Door (Su):</B> The creature can teleport, as <I>dimension door</I>, once per round as a free
        action.
        <br><br>
        <B>Dominate Person (Sp):</B> You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that
        you establish with the subject's mind. If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force
        the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can
        communicate only basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," and "Stand still." You know what the
        subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you
        telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that
        command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as
        sleeping, eating, and so forth). Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the
        equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
        <br><br>
        <B>Electricity Ray (Su):</B> The creature can fire a ray of electricity once per round with a range of 50 feet.
        It requires a ranged touch attack.
        <br><br>
        <B>Engulf (Ex):</B> The creature can wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its body as a standard action, pinning
        it.
        <br><br>
        <B>Entangle (Wis):</B> The creature can animate plants within 30 feet as a free action (Reflex DC 10 + 1/2 HD +
        Wis mod partial).
        <br><br>
        <B>Ethereal Jaunt (Su):</B> The creature can shift to the Ethereal Plane as the spell.
        <br><br>
        <B>Fear Aura (Cha):</B> The creature can create an aura of fear in a 20-foot radius. Creatures must make a Will
        save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha mod) or be affected by <I>fear</I>.
        <br><br>
        <B>Feed (Su):</B> When the creature slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse to gain Hit Dice and
        ability score increases.
        <br><br>
        <B>Hardness (Ex):</B> The creature has hardness, reducing damage from physical attacks.
        <br><br>
        <B>Heat (Ex):</B> The creature's body is intensely hot. Unarmed attacks and metallic weapons deal extra fire
        damage.
        <br><br>
        <B>Impale (Ex):</B> The creature deals 3d8+9 points of piercing damage to a grabbed opponent with a successful
        grapple check.
        <br><br>
        <B>Improved Grab (Ex):</B> If the creature hits with a natural weapon, it can attempt to start a grapple as a
        free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
        <br><br>
        <B>Lay on Hands (Su):</B> The creature can heal damage equal to its full normal hit points each day.
        <br><br>
        <B>Leap (Ex):</B> The creature can jump into the air during combat to make four claw attacks.
        <br><br>
        <B>Madness (Ex):</B> The creature uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of its Wisdom modifier, and
        has immunity to confusion and insanity effects. The creature cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of
        a miracle or wish spell.
        <br><br>
        <B>Madness (Su):</B> Anyone targeting the creature with thought detection or mind control takes 1d4 Wisdom
        damage.
        <br><br>
        <B>Moan (Ex):</B> The creature can emit a dangerous subsonic moan to cause unnerve, fear, nausea, or stupor
        effects.
        <br><br>
        <B>Mucus Cloud (Con):</B> Underwater, the creature is surrounded by a cloud. Contact requires a Fortitude save
        (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Con mod) or lose the ability to breathe air for 3 hours.
        <br><br>
        <B>Paralytic Tentacles (Ex):</B> The creature can transfer grabbed victims to its tentacles, which exude a
        paralytic secretion. Fortitude save or be paralyzed.
        <br><br>
        <B>Petrifying Gaze (Su):</B> Turn to stone permanently, range 30 feet; Fortitude save negates.
        <br><br>
        <B>Poison (Con):</B> Natural attacks deliver poison. Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Con mod) or take ability
        damage (usually Strength or Constitution).
        <br><br>
        <B>Protective Aura (Cha):</B> Against evil creatures, provides +4 deflection to AC and +4 resistance to saves to
        anyone within 20 feet. Functions as <I>magic circle against evil</I> and <I>lesser globe of invulnerability</I>.
        <br><br>
        <B>Protective Slime (Su):</B> A slimy red jelly coats the creature's skin. Any weapon that touches it takes 1d8
        points of acid damage from the corrosive goo, and the weapon's hardness does not reduce this damage. A magic
        weapon may attempt a Reflex save to avoid taking this damage. A creature who strikes the creature with an
        unarmed attack, unarmed strike, touch spell, or natural weapon takes this damage as well but can negate the
        damage with a Reflex save.
        <br><br>
        <B>Quickness (Su):</B> The creature can take an extra standard action or move action during its turn each round.
        <br><br>
        <B>Rake (Ex):</B> The creature gains extra natural attacks when it grapples its foe.
        <br><br>
        <B>Shadow Shift (Su):</B> The creature can manipulate shadows to obscure vision or create images.
        <br><br>
        <B>Slime (Con):</B> A blow from the creature's tentacle causes a transformation. Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD
        + Con mod) or skin becomes slimy membrane, taking damage if not kept wet.
        <br><br>
        <B>Smoke Claws (Ex):</B> In smoke form, the creature can engulf opponents, dealing damage and causing them to
        inhale smoke.
        <br><br>
        <B>Smoke Form (Su):</B> The creature can assume a gaseous form at will.
        <br><br>
        <B>Spell Deflection (Su):</B> The trapped essence provides a measure of magical protection. If any of the
        following spells are cast at the creature and overcome its spell resistance, they affect the imprisoned essence
        instead: banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person,
        fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnosis, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of
        charm or compulsion. In many cases, this deflection effectively neutralizes the spell. Some of these effects
        might eliminate the trapped essence, depriving the creature of its spell-like abilities until it can consume
        another victim.
        <br><br>
        <B>Spit Acid (Con):</B> The creature can spit a line of acid. Reflex save for half damage.
        <br><br>
        <B>Stun (Str):</B> If the creature strikes an opponent twice in one round, the target must make a Fortitude save
        (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Str mod) or be stunned.
        <br><br>
        <B>Swallow Whole (Ex):</B> The creature can swallow a grabbed opponent of a smaller size category.
        <br><br>
        <B>Teleport (Su):</B> The creature can use <I>greater teleport</I> at will (self plus objects).
        <br><br>
        <B>Tongues (Su):</B> The creature can speak with any creature that has a language.
        <br><br>
        <B>Trap Essence (Su):</B> The creature is named for its ability to consume an enemy's life essence. To do so, it
        must forgo its normal melee attacks and make a trap essence attack. This requires a normal attack roll but deals
        no damage. A slain creature's essence is trapped within the creature's ribs, and the tiny figure takes on that
        victim's features. The trapped essence cannot be raised or resurrected, but a limited wish, miracle, or wish
        spell frees it, as does destroying the creature. The creature can hold only one essence at a time. The trapped
        essence provides the creature with enough power to use five spell-like abilities for each Hit Die or level of
        the trapped creature. As this energy is expended, the twisted soul fades away until it evaporates completely.
        The trapped essence gains one negative level for every five times the creature uses one of its spell-like
        abilities. When the essence's number of negative levels equals the creature's total Hit Dice or level, the
        essence is destroyed. If an essence is freed, the restored creature must succeed on a Fortitude save for each
        negative level or lose that level permanently.
        <br><br>
        <B>Tremorsense (Ex):</B> The creature can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in
        contact with the ground.
        <br><br>
        <B>True Seeing (Su):</B> The creature has <I>true seeing</I> continuously active.
        <br><br>
        <B>Web (Con):</B> The creature can throw a web to entangle opponents. Escape Artist or Strength check to escape.
        <br><br>
        <B>Whirlwind Blast (Su):</B> When in whirlwind form, the creature can attack with a scouring blast of wind.
        <br><br>
        <B>Wisdom Drain (Su):</B> The creature causes Wisdom drain with its touch attack.
