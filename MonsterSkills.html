    <h1>Monster Skills</h1>
    <p>
        <B>Barbed Defense (Su):</B> Any creature striking the creature with handheld weapons or natural weapons takes
        1d8+8 points of piercing and slashing damage from the creature's barbs. Note that weapons with exceptional
        reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way.
        <br><br>
        <B>Blindsight (Ex):</B> The creature can use nonvisual senses (hearing, scent, vibration, or other environmental
        clues) to detect and pinpoint the location of creatures within 60 feet. Invisibility and darkness are
        irrelevant, though the creature still can't discern ethereal beings. Blindsight never allows a creature to
        distinguish color or visual contrast, and a creature cannot read with blindsight. The creature does not need to
        make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight.
        <br><br>
        <B>Blink (Su):</B> The creature can use <I>blink</I> as the spell, and can evoke or end the effect as a free
        action.
        <br><br>
        <B>Breath Weapon (Su):</B> The creature breathes a cone or line of energy (fire, acid, electricity, etc.).
        Creatures in the area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC varies) or take damage.
        <br><br>
        <B>Burn (Ex):</B> A fire elemental's slam attack deals bludgeoning damage plus fire damage from the elemental's
        flaming body. Those hit by a fire elemental's slam attack also must succeed on a Reflex save or catch on fire.
        The flame burns for 1d4 rounds. A burning creature can take a move action to put out the flame. Creatures
        hitting a fire elemental with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take fire damage as though hit by the
        elemental's attack, and also catch on fire unless they succeed on a Reflex save.
        <br><br>
        <B>Change Shape (Su):</B> The creature can assume the shape of any Small or Medium humanoid. In humanoid form,
        the creature loses its natural attacks. A creature can remain in its humanoid form until it chooses to assume a
        new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but a creature reverts to its natural form when killed. A <I>true
            seeing</I> spell or ability reveals its natural form.
        <br><br>
        <B>Constrict (Ex):</B> The creature deals automatic damage (usually slam + Strength bonus) to a grabbed opponent
        with a successful grapple check.
        <br><br>
        <B>Corrosive Slime (Ex):</B> The creature produces a mucus that eats away at metal, wood, and flesh. Any melee
        hit deals extra acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless the wearer
        succeeds on a Reflex save (DC varies). Weapons striking the creature also dissolve immediately unless the
        wielder succeeds on a Reflex save.
        <br><br>
        <B>Death Throes (Ex):</B> When killed, the creature turns to ice and shatters in an explosion that deals cold
        and piercing damage to everything within 100 feet (Reflex half).
        <br><br>
        <B>Destructive Harmonics (Su):</B> The creature can blast sonic energy in a cone of up to 80 feet. It can tune
        the harmonics to deal damage to creatures, damage to objects, or nonlethal damage.
        <br><br>
        <B>Drench (Ex):</B> The elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames
        of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as
        <I>dispel magic</I> (caster level equals the elemental's HD).
        <br><br>
        <B>Earth Glide (Ex):</B> An earth elemental can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth
        except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it
        create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A <I>move earth</I> spell cast on an area containing a
        burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it
        succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
        <br><br>
        <B>Energy Drain (Su):</B> Living creatures hit by the creature's attack gain negative levels. The DC is
        Charisma-based. The creature gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level bestowed.
        <br><br>
        <B>Ethereal Jaunt (Su):</B> The creature can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free
        action, and shift back again as a move action (or as part of a move action). The ability is otherwise identical
        with the <I>ethereal jaunt</I> spell.
        <br><br>
        <B>Hive Mind (Ex):</B> All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant communication. If one is
        aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not flat-footed, none of them are. No formian
        in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.
        <br><br>
        <B>Impale (Ex):</B> The creature deals extra damage to a grabbed opponent with a successful grapple check.
        <br><br>
        <B>Improved Grab (Ex):</B> To use this ability, the creature must hit with a specific attack (usually a claw or
        bite). It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
        <br><br>
        <B>Madness (Ex):</B> The creature uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of its Wisdom modifier, and
        has immunity to <I>confusion</I> and <I>insanity</I> effects. A creature targeting it with thought detection,
        mind control, or telepathic ability takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.
        <br><br>
        <B>Poison (Ex):</B> The creature delivers a poison with a successful attack (usually a bite or sting). The
        poison deals initial and secondary damage (usually Ability damage) unless the victim succeeds on a Fortitude
        save (DC varies).
        <br><br>
        <B>Pounce (Ex):</B> If the creature charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.
        <br><br>
        <B>Protective Slime (Su):</B> A slimy red jelly coats the creature's skin. The jelly grants a +8 bonus on Escape
        Artist checks and checks made to escape a grapple. Weapons striking the creature take acid damage (Reflex
        negates).
        <br><br>
        <B>Push (Ex):</B> An earth elemental can start a bull rush maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity.
        The combat modifiers given in Earth Mastery also apply to the elemental's opposed Strength checks.
        <br><br>
        <B>Rake (Ex):</B> The creature gains extra natural attacks when it grapples its foe.
        <br><br>
        <B>Ray (Su):</B> The creature can fire a ray of energy (fire, cold, electricity, etc.) as a ranged touch attack.
        <br><br>
        <B>Rend (Ex):</B> If the creature hits with two or more claw attacks, it latches onto the opponent’s body and
        tears the flesh. This attack deals extra damage.
        <br><br>
        <B>Spell Deflection (Su):</B> The creature can deflect spells cast at it, affecting the imprisoned essence
        instead.
        <br><br>
        <B>Summon (Sp):</B> The creature can summon other creatures of its kind (or related creatures) to aid it in
        battle. This ability functions like a <I>summon monster</I> spell, but the summoned creatures remain for 1 hour.
        <br><br>
        <B>Trample (Ex):</B> As a full-round action, the creature can move up to twice its speed and literally run over
        any opponents at least one size category smaller than itself. The creature merely has to move over the opponents
        in its path; any creature whose space is completely covered by the trampling creature’s space is subject to the
        trample attack.
        <br><br>
        <B>Trap Essence (Su):</B> The creature can trap the life force of a slain living creature. The trapped essence
        provides the creature with magical power.
        <br><br>
        <B>Trill (Su):</B> The creature can emit a noise that forces its prey to stand motionless. This sonic
        mind-affecting compulsion affects all creatures within a 100-foot radius. Creatures must succeed on a Will save
        or be stunned.
        <br><br>
        <B>Trip (Ex):</B> A creature that hits with a specific attack can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action
        without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot
        react to trip the creature.
        <br><br>
        <B>Vortex (Su):</B> The elemental can transform itself into a whirlpool once every 10 minutes and remain in that
        form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. In this form, the elemental can move through the water or along
        the bottom at its swim speed. The vortex is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and 10 to 50
        feet tall. The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.
        <br><br>
        <B>Web (Ex):</B> The creature can throw a web eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but
        has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of up to
        Medium size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.
        <br><br>
        <B>Whirlwind (Su):</B> The elemental can transform itself into a whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in
        that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. In this form, the elemental can move through the air or along
        a surface at its fly speed. The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and up to
        50 feet tall.
    </p>

    <h3>Freeze (Ex)</h3>
    <p>A gargoyle can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. An observer must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to
        notice the gargoyle is really alive.</p>

    <h3>Air Mastery (Ex)</h3>
    <p>Airborne creatures take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a djinni.</p>

    <h3>Heat (Ex)</h3>
    <p>An efreeti’s body deals 1d6 points of extra fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it maintains
        a hold when grappling.</p>

    <h3>Gaze (Su)</h3>
    <p>In humanoid form&#151;slay evil creatures of 5 or fewer HD, range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates. Even if the save
        succeeds, the creature is affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell for 2d10 rounds. Nonevil creatures, and evil
        creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell
        for 2d10 rounds. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>

    <h3>Light Ray (Ex)</h3>
    <p>A ghaele in globe form can project light rays with a range of 300 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of
        any type.</p>

    <h3>Protective Aura (Su)</h3>
    <p>Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and
        a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the ghaele. Otherwise, it functions as a
        <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>, both with a radius of 20
        feet (caster level 14th). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a ghaele's statistics
        block.)
    </p>

    <h3>Ghoul Fever (Su)</h3>
    <p>Disease&#151;bite, Fortitude DC 10, incubation period 1 day, damage 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex. The save DC is
        Charisma-based.</p>

    <h3>Stench (Ex)</h3>
    <p>The stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures within 10 feet
        must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6+4 minutes. A creature that successfully saves
        cannot be affected again by the same ghast's stench for 24 hours. A <i>delay poison</i> or <i>neutralize
            poison</i> spell removes the effect from a sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are
        unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. The save DC is
        Charisma-based.</p>

    <h3>Rock Throwing (Ex)</h3>
    <p>Adult giants are accomplished rock throwers and receive a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A
        giant of at least Large size can hurl rocks weighing 40 to 50 pounds each (Small objects) up to five range
        increments. The range increment is 120 feet for a Huge giant's thrown rocks (or 140 feet for a cloud giant's
        rocks). A Huge giant can hurl rocks of 60 to 80 pounds (Medium objects).</p>

    <h3>Rock Catching (Ex)</h3>
    <p>A giant of at least Large size can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape). Once
        per round, a giant that would normally be hit by a rock can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The
        DC is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one. (If the projectile provides a magical
        bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) The giant must be ready for and aware of the attack in
        order to make a rock catching attempt.</p>

    <h3>Oversized Weapon (Ex)</h3>
    <p>A giant wields a greatsword (or other weapon) about one size category larger than the giant itself without
        penalty.</p>

    <h3>Freedom of Movement (Su)</h3>
    <p>Storm giants have a continuous freedom of movement ability as the spell (caster level 20th). The effect can be
        dispelled, but the storm giant can create it again on its next turn as a free action.</p>

    <h3>Water Breathing (Ex)</h3>
    <p>Storm giants can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use their spell-like abilities while submerged.
    </p>

    <h3>Gibbering (Su)</h3>
    <p>As a free action, a gibbering mouther can emit a bewildering cacophony of insane babbling sounds. All creatures
        (other than mouthers) within a 60-foot spread must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected as though by a
        <i>confusion</i> spell for 1d2 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion. A creature that saves cannot
        be affected by the same mouther's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>

    <h3>Spittle (Ex)</h3>
    <p>As a free action every round, a gibbering mouther can fire a stream of spittle at one opponent within 30 feet.
        The mouther makes a ranged touch attack; if it hits, it deals 1d4 points of acid damage, and the target must
        succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Eyeless creatures are immune to the blinding
        effect, but still take the acid damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>

    <h3>Engulf (Ex)</h3>
    <p>A gibbering mouther can try to engulf a Medium or smaller opponent grabbed by three or more mouths. The opponent
        must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save or fall and be engulfed. In each round, the mouther deals 2d8+3 points of
        crushing damage and 1d8 points of acid damage to an engulfed creature. An engulfed creature is considered to be
        grappled and trapped within the mouther’s body. The mouther can still use its mouths to attack other targets.
    </p>

    <h3>Blood Drain (Ex)</h3>
    <p>A gibbering mouther drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage in any round when it begins its turn
        with a victim grappled.</p>

    <h3>Ground Manipulation (Su)</h3>
    <p>At will, as a standard action, a gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth in all adjacent squares to become a
        morass of soft dough. Creatures in the area must make a DC 13 Reflex save or become stuck. Stuck creatures can
        break free with a DC 13 Strength check or a DC 13 Escape Artist check. Moving through the dough costs 2 squares
        of movement for every square entered. The dough hardens back to normal stone or earth in 1 minute.</p>

    <h3>Amorphous (Ex)</h3>
    <p>A gibbering mouther is not subject to critical hits. It has no clear front or back, so it cannot be flanked.</p>

    <h3>Nondetection (Su)</h3>
    <p>A svirfneblin has a continuous nondetection ability as the spell (caster level 10th).</p>

    <h3>Berserk (Ex)</h3>
    <p>When a clay or flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit
        breaks free and the golem goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living
        creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread
        more destruction. The golem’s creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and
        persuasively to the golem, which requires a DC 19 Charisma check. It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the golem
        to reset the golem’s berserk chance to 0%.</p>

    <h3>Cursed Wound (Ex)</h3>
    <p>The damage a clay golem deals doesn’t heal naturally. A <i>remove curse</i> or <i>break enchantment</i> spell
        leaves the damage treatable by magic, but a caster must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check to heal the
        damage.</p>

    <h3>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</h3>
    <p>A golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells
        and effects function differently against the creature, as noted in its entry.</p>
