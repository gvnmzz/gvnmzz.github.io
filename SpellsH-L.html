Hallow<br>
Evocation [Good]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 24 hours<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Area:</B> 40-ft. radius emanating from the touched point<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> See text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> See text<br>
<I>Hallow </I>makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site. This has four major effects.<br>
First, the site or structure is guarded by a <I>magic circle against evil </I>effect.<br>
Second, all Charisma checks made to turn undead gain a +4 sacred bonus, and Charisma checks to command undead take a &#150;4 penalty. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. (This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.)<br>
Third, any dead body interred in a <I>hallowed </I>site cannot be turned into an undead creature.<br>
Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the <I>hallowed </I>site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting <I>hallow </I>again.<br>
Spell effects that may be tied to a <I>hallowed </I>site include <I>aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect evil, detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, </I>and <I>zone of truth</I>. Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)<br>
An area can receive only one <I>hallow </I>spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. <I>Hallow </I>counters but does not dispel <I>unhallow</I>.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>Herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be included in the <I>hallowed </I>area.<br>
<br>
Hallucinatory Terrain<br>
Illusion (Glamer)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Area:</B> One 30-ft. cube per caster level (S)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 2 hours per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will disbelief (if interacted with)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You make natural terrain look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Area:</B> One 20-ft. cube per caster level (S)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration +1 hour/ level (D)<br>
You can make any area appear to be something other than it is. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. You can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where none are present). Still, it can't disguise, conceal, or add creatures (though creatures within the area might hide themselves within the illusion just as they can hide themselves within a real location).<br>
<br>
Halt Undead<br>
Necromancy<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to three undead creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (see text)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of <I>hold person </I>on a living creature). The effect is broken if the <I>halted </I>creatures are attacked or take damage.<br>
<br>
Harm<br>
Necromancy<br>
<B>Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will half; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
<I>Harm </I>charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level). If the creature successfully saves, <I>harm </I>deals half this amount, but it cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than 1.<br>
If used on an undead creature, <I>harm </I>acts like <I>heal</I>.<br>
<br>
Haste<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One creature per caster level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Fortitude negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.<br>
When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)<br>
A <I>hasted </I>creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.<br>
All of the <I>hasted </I>creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed.<br>
Multiple <I>haste </I>effects don't stack. <I>Haste </I>dispels and counters <I>slow</I>.<br>
<br>
Heal<br>
Conjuration (Healing)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
<I>Heal </I>enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the Target: ability damage, blinded, <I>confused, </I>dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, <I>feebleminded, </I>insanity, nauseated, sickened, stunned, and poisoned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.<br>
<I>Heal </I>does not remove negative levels, restore permanently drained levels, or restore permanently drained ability score points.<br>
If used against an undead creature, <I>heal </I>instead acts like <I>harm</I>.<br>
<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 9<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
The maximum number of hit points restored to each creature is 250.<br>
<br>
Heat Metal<br>
Transmutation [Fire]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target: </B>Metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or 25 lb. of metal per caster level, all of which must be within a 30-ft. circle<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 7 rounds<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (object)<br>
<I>Heat metal </I>makes metal extremely warm. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.<br>
A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.<br>
On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.<br>
</font><table width="95%" border="1">
<!-- Table 01 Row 01 -->

Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. If cast underwater, <I>heat metal </I>deals half damage and boils the surrounding water.<br>
<I>Heat metal </I>counters and dispels <I>chill metal</I>.<br>

Helping Hand<br>
Evocation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> 5 miles<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Ghostly hand<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to find a creature within 5 miles. The hand then beckons to that creature and leads it to you if the creature is willing to follow.<br>
When the spell is cast, the hand appears in front of you. You then specify a person (or any creature) by physical description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. When the description is complete, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away she is.<br>

Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it. If the subject does so, the hand points in your direction, indicating the most direct feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it disappears.<br>
The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on her own devices to locate you.<br>
If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.<br>
If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.<br>
The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can't pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour plus 12 hours; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You bring forth a great feast, including a magnificent table, chairs, service, and food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over. Every creature partaking of the feast is cured of all diseases, sickness, and nausea; becomes immune to poison for 12 hours; and gains 1d8 temporary hit points +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10) after imbibing the nectar-like beverage that is part of the feast. The ambrosial food that is consumed grants each creature that partakes a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and Will saves and immunity to fear effects for 12 hours.<br>
If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and all effects of the spell are negated.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 10 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
Animals cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Animals simply act as though the warded creatures are not there. If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any creature, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients.<br>
<br>
Hide from Undead<br>

<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless); see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
Undead cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Nonintelligent undead creatures are automatically affected and act as though the warded creatures are not there. An intelligent undead creature gets a single Will saving throw. If it fails, the subject can't see any of the warded creatures. However, if it has reason to believe unseen opponents are present, it can attempt to find or strike them. If a warded creature attempts to turn or command undead, touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature (even with a spell), the spell ends for all recipients.<br>
<br>
Hideous Laughter<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the spell ends, it can act normally.<br>
A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is not affected. A creature whose type is different from the caster's receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn't &#147;translate&#148; well.<br>
<br>
Hold<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D); see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. (This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.)<br>
A winged creature who is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Target:</B> Any one living creature<br>
The spell affects any living creature that fails its Will save.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 7<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One or more humanoid or animal creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>

<B>At Higher Level:</B> 9<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
The spell affects multiple creatures and holds any living creature that fails its Will save.<br>

Hold Portal<br>
Abjuration<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A <I>knock </I>spell or a successful <I>dispel magic </I>spell can negate a <I>hold portal </I>spell.<br>
For a portal affected by this spell, add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open the portal.<br>
<br>
Holy Aura<br>
Abjuration [Good]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>

<B>Targets:</B> One creature per caster level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> See text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become blinded when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.<br>
First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike <I>protection from evil</I>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.<br>
Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.<br>
Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as <I>protection from evil </I>does.<br>
Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as <I>blindness/deafness</I>, but against <I>holy aura's </I>save DC).<br>
<I>Focus: </I>A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic. The reliquary costs at least 500 gp.<br>
<br>
Holy Smite<br>
Evocation [Good]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Area:</B> 20-ft.-radius burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous (1 round); see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will partial; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good creatures are unaffected.<br>
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to each evil creature in the area (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider) and causes it to become blinded for 1 round. A successful Will saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinded effect.<br>
The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither good nor evil, and they are not blinded. Such a creature can reduce that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.<br>
<br>
Holy Sword<br>
Evocation [Good]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target: </B>Melee weapon touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a <I>+5 holy weapon </I>(+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against evil opponents). It also emits a <I>magic circle against evil </I>effect (as the spell). If the <I>magic circle </I>ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one <I>holy sword </I>at a time.<br>
If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with <I>bless weapon </I>or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way.<br>
This spell does not work on artifacts.<br>
<I>Note: </I>A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.<br>

This spell evaporates moisture from the body of each subject living creature, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, which instead take 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8).<br>

<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the air, fascinating creatures within it. Roll 2d4 and add your caster level (maximum 10) to determine the total number of Hit Dice of creatures affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Affected creatures become fascinated by the pattern of colors. Sightless creatures are not affected.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 2d4 rounds (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures, causing them to stop and stare blankly at you. In addition, you can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how many total Hit Dice of creatures you affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more HD. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you to be fascinated.<br>
If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw. If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of &#150;2.<br>
While the subject is fascinated by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude. This allows you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particular request.<br>
A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it.<br>

Great magical hailstones pound down for 1 full round, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage to every creature in the area. A &#150;4 penalty applies to each Listen check made within the <I>ice storm</I>'s effect, and all land movement within its area is at half speed.

<B>Duration:</B> One day per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The <I>illusory script </I>appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting are able to read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character, although an illusionist recognizes it as <I>illusory script.<br>
</I>Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes. Typical suggestions include &#147;Close the book and leave,&#148; &#147;Forget the existence of the book,&#148; and so forth. If successfully dispelled by <I>dispel magic, </I>the <I>illusory script </I>and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the <I>true seeing </I>spell with the <I>read magic </I>or <I>comprehend languages </I>spell.<br>
The casting time depends on how long a message you wish to write, but it is always at least 1 minute.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>A lead-based ink (cost of not less than 50 gp).<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Permanent<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will disbelief (if interacted with)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a probing search reveals the true nature of the surface, though such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear.<br>

Implosion<br>
Evocation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 9<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Concentration (up to 4 rounds)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Fortitude negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You create a destructive resonance in a corporeal creature's body. For each round you concentrate, you cause one creature to collapse in on itself, killing it. (This effect, being instantaneous, cannot be dispelled.)<br>
You can target a particular creature only once with each casting of the spell.<br>
<I>Implosion </I>has no effect on creatures in gaseous form or on incorporeal creatures.<br>

<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
When you cast <I>imprisonment </I>and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the <I>temporal stasis </I>spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The subject remains there unless a <I>freedom </I>spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a <I>crystal ball, </I>a <I>locate object </I>spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but <I>discern location </I>does. A <I>wish </I>or <I>miracle </I>spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a &#150;4 penalty on its save.<br>

Incendiary Cloud<br>
Conjuration (Creation) [Fire]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Reflex half; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
An <I>incendiary cloud </I>spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot through with white-hot embers. The smoke obscures all sight as a <I>fog cloud </I>does. In addition, the white-hot embers within the cloud deal 4d6 points of fire damage to everything within the cloud on your turn each round. All targets can make Reflex saves each round to take half damage.<br>
As with a <I>cloudkill </I>spell, the smoke moves away from you at 10 feet per round. Figure out the smoke's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from where you were when you cast the spell. By concentrating, you can make the cloud (actually its point of origin) move as much as 60 feet each round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the remainder's spread thereafter.<br>
As with <I>fog cloud</I>, wind disperses the smoke, and the spell can't be cast underwater.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will half<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
When laying your hand upon a creature, you channel negative energy that deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).<br>
Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures such a creature of a like amount of damage, rather than harming it.<br>
Necromancy<br>
<B>At Higher Levels: </B>2-4<br>
It deals 1d8 more points of damage per spell level above 1st (maximum 4d8 at spell level 4).<br>
<B>At Higher Levels: </B>5-8<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature per caster level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You summon a number of swarms of locusts (one per three levels, to a maximum of six swarms at 18th level). The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). You may summon the locust swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after being summoned, and won't pursue creatures that flee.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Permanent until discharged<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You call some nonliving item from virtually any location directly to your hand.<br>
First, you must place your <I>arcane mark</I> on the item. Then you cast this spell, which magically and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on a sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp. Thereafter, you can summon the item by speaking a special word (set by you when the spell is cast) and crushing the gem. The item appears instantly in your hand. Only you can use the gem in this way.<br>
If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, but you know who the possessor is and roughly where that creature is located when the summons occurs.<br>
The inscription on the gem is invisible. It is also unreadable, except by means of a <I>read magic </I>spell, to anyone but you.<br>
The item can be summoned from another plane, but only if no other creature has claimed ownership of it.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>A sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp.<br>

Interposing Hand<br>
Evocation [Force]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> 10-ft. hand<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
<I>Interposing hand </I>creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand&#151;it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.<br>
An <I>interposing hand </I>is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you're undamaged, and its AC is 20 (&#150;1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it.<br>
The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. It cannot push through a <I>wall of force </I>or enter an <I>antimagic field</I>, but it suffers the full effect of a <I>prismatic wall </I>or <I>prismatic sphere. </I>The hand makes saving throws as its caster.<br>
<I>Disintegrate </I>or a successful <I>dispel magic </I>destroys it.<br>
Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature's attacks.<br>
Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.<br>
Forceful Hand<br>
Evocation [Force]<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 6<br>
The hand pursues and pushes away the opponent that you designate. Treat this attack as a bull rush with a +14 bonus on the Strength check (+8 for Strength 27, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets). The hand always moves with the opponent to push that target back the full distance allowed, and it has no speed limit. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.<br>
A very strong creature could not push the hand out of its way because the latter would instantly reposition itself between the creature and you, but an opponent could push the hand up against you by successfully bull rushing it.<br>
Grasping Hand<br>
Evocation [Force]<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 7<br>
The hand can also grapple one opponent that you select. The hand gets one grapple attack per round.<br>
Its attack bonus to make contact equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, +10 for the hand's Strength score (31), &#150;1 for being Large. Its grapple bonus is this same figure, except with a +4 modifier for being Large instead of &#150;1. The hand holds but does not harm creatures it grapples.<br>
Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.<br>
The hand can also bull rush an opponent, but at a +16 bonus on the Strength check (+10 for Strength 35, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets), or interpose itself.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 8<br>
The hand can interpose itself, push, or strike one opponent that you select. The floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours.<br>
The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, +11 for the hand's Strength score (33), &#150;1 for being Large. The hand deals 1d8+11 points of damage on each attack, and any creature struck must make a Fortitude save (against this spell's save DC) or be stunned for 1 round. Directing the spell to a new target is a free interaction.<br>
The <I>clenched fist </I>can also interpose itself as <I>interposing hand </I>does, or it can bull rush an opponent as <I>forceful hand </I>does, but at a +15 bonus on the Strength check.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 9<br>
The hand can interpose itself, push, or crush one opponent that you select.<br>
The <I>crushing hand </I>can grapple an opponent like <I>grasping hand </I>does. Its grapple bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, +12 for the hand's Strength score (35), +4 for being Large. The hand deals 2d6+12 points of damage (lethal, not nonlethal) on each successful grapple check against an opponent.<br>
The <I>crushing hand </I>can also interpose itself as <I>interposing hand </I>does, or it can bull rush an opponent as <I>forceful hand </I>does, but at a +18 bonus.<br>
Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.<br>

<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless) or Yes (harmless, object)<br>
The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.<br>
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.<br>
Of course, the subject is not magically <I>silenced, </I>and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as <I>bless </I>that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.<br>
<I>Invisibility </I>can be made permanent (on objects only) with a <I>permanency </I>spell.<br>
<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Area:</B> 10-ft.-radius emanation around the creature or object touched<br>
This spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient.<br>
Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the spell ends.<br>

<B>Targets:</B> Any number of creatures, no two of which can be more than 180 ft. apart<br>
The effect is mobile with the group and is broken when anyone in the group attacks. Individuals in the group cannot see each other. The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest member of the group. (If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 180 feet.)<br>

<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
This spell transforms your body into living iron, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities.<br>
You gain damage reduction 15/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems.<br>
You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a &#150;6 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 50% and a &#150;8 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments.<br>
Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.<br>
Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean&#151;at least until the spell duration expires.<br>

<I>Ironwood </I>is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While remaining natural wood in almost every way, <I>ironwood </I>is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron do not function on <I>ironwood</I>. Spells that affect wood do affect <I>ironwood</I>, although <I>ironwood </I>does not burn. Using this spell with <I>wood shape </I>or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids.<br>
Further, if you make only half as much <I>ironwood </I>as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>Wood shaped into the form of the intended <I>ironwood </I>object.<br>

The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete with foot shuffling and tapping. The spell effect makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place. The effect imposes a &#150;4 penalty to Armor Class and a &#150;10 penalty on Reflex saves, and it negates any AC bonus granted by a shield the target holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on its turn.<br>

<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>

<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless, object)<br>
This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19&#150;20, a threat range of 19&#150;20 becomes 17&#150;20, and a threat range of 18&#150;20 becomes 15&#150;20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the <I>keen edge </I>on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. (Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.)<br>
Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range (such as the <I>keen edge </I>spell and the Improved Critical feat) don't stack. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.<br>

Knock<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One door, box, or chest with an area of up to 10 sq. ft. per caster level<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
The <I>knock </I>spell opens stuck, barred, locked, <I>held, </I>or <I>arcane locked </I>doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold closures shut). If used to open a <I>arcane locked </I>door, the spell does not remove the <I>arcane lock </I>but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. <I>Knock </I>does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress. <br>

You instantly know the direction of north from your current position. The spell is effective in any environment in which &#147;north&#148; exists, but it may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of north is correct at the moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments if you don't find some external reference point to help you keep track of direction.<br>

<I>Legend lore </I>brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4x10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better <I>legend lore </I>result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better <I>legend lore </I>result next time).<br>
During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are &#147;legendary,&#148; as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>Incense worth at least 250 gp.<br>
<I>Focus: </I>Four strips of ivory (worth 50 gp each) formed into a rectangle.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 7<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
The spell works more quickly but produces some strain on you. You pose a question about some person, place, or object, then cast the spell. If the person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in question, you receive a vision about it by succeeding on a caster level check (1d20 +1 per caster level) against DC 20. If only detailed information on the person, place, or object is known, the DC is 25, and the information gained is incomplete. If only rumors are known, the DC is 30, and the information gained is vague.<br>

<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal or close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> You or one willing creature or one object (total weight up to 100 lb. per caster level)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
<I>Levitate </I>allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be <I>levitated, </I>and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).<br>
A <I>levitating </I>creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a &#150;1 penalty on attack rolls, the second &#150;2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of &#150;5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at &#150;1.<br>

This spell causes an object to glow like a torch, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for an additional 20 feet) from the point you touch. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical <I>darkness </I>does not function.<br>
A light spell (one with the light descriptor) counters and dispels a darkness spell (one with the darkness descriptor) of an equal or lower level.<br>

<B>Saving Throw:</B> Reflex half<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips.<br>
The <I>lightning bolt </I>sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.<br>

A <I>limited wish </I>lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a <I>limited wish </I>can do any of the following things.<br>
&#149; Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.<br>
&#149; Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.<br>
&#149; Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.<br>
&#149; Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.<br>
&#149; Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as <I>geas/quest </I>or <I>insanity</I>.<br>
&#149; Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a &#150;7 penalty on its next saving throw.<br>
A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal (but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell). When a <I>limited wish </I>spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component.<br>
<I>Material component: </I>A diamond worth at least 1,500 gp.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> One day per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can be cast on only a single tree at a time; while <I>liveoak </I>is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree. The tree on which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 300 feet of something that you wish to guard or protect.<br>
<I>Liveoak </I>must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. The <I>liveoak </I>spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant. <br>
If <I>liveoak </I>is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately, wherever it happens to be. If released by you, the tree tries to return to its original location before taking root.<br>

You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. You can search for general items, in which case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination).<br>
The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell. <I>Polymorph any object </I>fools it.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 min. per caster level<br>
This spell locates a known or familiar creature.<br>
You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any.<br>
The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain type. To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once.<br>
Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by <I>mislead</I>, <I>nondetection</I>, and <I>polymorph </I>spells.<br>
