    <h1>History and Nature</h1>

    <h2>The Green Tide (The Verdant Reclamation)</h2>
    <p>
        At some point in the recent past (approx. 50 years ago), a supernatural event occurred where nature aggressively
        reclaimed the world. It was not a slow growth, but a sudden, violent explosion of life known as <strong>The
            Green
            Tide</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Timeline of the Fall</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Day 1 (The Bloom):</strong> Simultaneous rapid growth of vines and roots in every major city.
            Pavement
            cracked, foundations shattered.</li>
        <li><strong>Week 1 (The Panic):</strong> Animals turned aggressive, forming a shared hive mind. Livestock
            attacked
            farmers; pets turned on owners. The "Green Fever" began affecting those who stayed too close to the new
            blooms.</li>
        <li><strong>Month 1 (The Collapse & The Ascent):</strong> Major cities were overrun.
            In a desperate bid for survival, the Council of Mages in Aelorium successfully inverted the gravity of the
            city's central district, ripping it from the earth.
            Seeing this, other cities attempted similar feats or fled. The Dwarves sealed their mountain gates (The
            Great
            Shutting). The Elves retreated into the deep wilds or the Feywild portals.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Verdant Hive Mind (The Voice of the Wild)</h2>
    <p>
        The animals and plants of Elarion are no longer separate entities. They are connected by a global, supernatural
        consciousness known as <strong>The Verdant Hive Mind</strong>. It is not a single god-like entity, but a billion
        instincts screaming in unison. It drives even docile herbivores to crush cobblestones and wolves to hunt in
        military formations.
    </p>

    <h3>The Silent Law</h3>
    <p>
        The Hive Mind tolerates survivors only if they obey the <strong>Silent Law</strong>:
        <br>1. <strong>No Permanence:</strong> You may camp for a night, maybe two. If you build a stone wall or lay a
        foundation, the Wild will tear it down.
        <br>2. <strong>No Hoarding:</strong> Large concentrations of magic or refined metal attract the Hive Mind like
        moths to a flame.
    </p>

    <h3>The Apexes</h3>
    <p>
        To enforce these laws, the Hive Mind evolves <strong>Apex Predators</strong> - monstrous, unique beasts that
        guard
        ruined cities and key ley lines. Examples include the <em>Glass-Spider of Sylvaris</em> or the <em>Iron-Bear of
            the
            Rustgarden</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Arcane Antagonism (Nature vs Magic)</h2>
    <p>
        Nature is particularly adverse to magic. It views arcane energy as a pollutant, a foreign frequency that
        disrupts
        the Hive Mind's song. The more powerful and long-lasting a magical effect is, the more violent the answer from
        the Wild. This phenomenon is known as <strong>The Arcane Antagonism</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>The Beacon Effect</h3>
    <p>
        Casting a spell sends a ripple through the Verdant Hive Mind, alerting nearby flora and fauna.
        <br><strong>Cantrips & Low Magic (1st-2nd Level):</strong> Generally ignored, or attract nearby insects and
        small
        birds.
        <br><strong>High Magic (3rd-5th Level):</strong> Like a siren. Wolves, bears, and rapid-growth vines will
        investigate the source within minutes.
        <br><strong>Rituals & Permanent Magic:</strong> A declaration of war. Use of <em>Teleportation Circles</em> or
        permanent <em>Walls of Force</em> attracts Apex Predators and rapid, crushing overgrowth.
