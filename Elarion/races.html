    <h1>Races of Elarion</h1>
    <p>
        Magic in this world is relatively new, so while low-tier magic is accessible to most, mid and high-level magic
        is greatly segmented among races and populations.
    </p>

    <h2>Humans</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Masters of Creation, Destruction, and Gravity.</strong><br>
        Humans can build many things, including weapons, magic wands, buildings, airships, and all practical tools.
        They recently discovered how to reverse gravity, enabling the creation of airships and floating cities.
        This gave them an edge in the run from nature. They built 3 floating cities and many other floating settlements.
        They were also able to build forges to create humanoid living constructs (the Forged).
    </p>

    <h2>Elves</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Masters of Resurrection and Teleportation.</strong><br>
        Elves know many things about planes and have lived in their holds and in the forests for a long time.
        Those living in the forest still live there in moving encampments, while those living in holds had to give them
        up and live in human floating cities, providing teleportation services.
        Resurrection is something they guard with their lives and use sparingly. They are good with magic and sword in
        general.
    </p>

    <h2>Half-Elves</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Masters of Dreams, Emotion, Persuasion, and Music.</strong><br>
        Born from the union of humans and elves, mostly in the cities. They struggle to find a place in the world, which
        made them masters of social and mental magic.
        They often work as diplomats between humans, elves, and other races.
    </p>

    <h2>Dwarves</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Masters of Architecture and Shaping Stone and Metal.</strong><br>
        Dwarves built enormous cities under the mountains, guarded with powerful magic. They are skilled combatants,
        forging superior weapons and armor.
        They are positioned in mountains where gold, Mithril, and Adamantine can be found. They absolutely hate the
        forest and wouldn't venture there unless necessary.
        Dwarves are very loyal to their clans; those found in human settlements are there for business.
        There are no reported half-dwarves.
    </p>

    <h2>Orcs</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Masters of Transformation and Adaptation.</strong><br>
        Important in the ecosystem, though not typically playable. They mastered wild shape, polymorph spells, and
        physical enhancement.
        They are tied to nature and have always lived in communion with it. They are the population most similar to
        druids.
        They are a closed society but their communities let in some forest elves, halflings, humans, and gnomes.
    </p>

    <h2>Half-Orcs</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Masters of Healing and Regeneration.</strong><br>
        Born in the more open orc communities. They draw from the druidic knowledge of orcs and the creation attitude of
        humans.
        They are welcome in cities and adventure parties for their knowledge of curative power.
    </p>

    <h2>Halflings</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Masters of Freedom, Travel, and Lightness.</strong><br>
        Organized in nomadic tribes. They mastered the training of riding animals, both on land and in the sky.
        Legends say they can control the weather, wind, and lightning. They offer assistance as guides or provide safe
        passage to airships.
        They are excellent at gathering and producing food and are generally friendly.
    </p>

    <h2>Gnomes</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Masters of Mind Link, Illusion, and Divination.</strong><br>
        The most mysterious race. They recently introduced "The Mind Link," a network allowing instantaneous mental
        communication across the region.
        They are also masters of illusion and good spies, able to hear and see without being detected.
    </p>

    <h2>The Forged</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Masters of Time.</strong><br>
        A race created by humans. They possess an unexplained mastery over time (Haste, Time Stop, etc.).
        It is unclear how they researched such powers so quickly.
    </p>

    <h2>Other Races</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Drows:</strong> Masters of Creature Binding. Live in the Underdark, forging pacts with Devils and
            Demons.</li>
        <li><strong>Kobolds:</strong> Revere dragons and are skilled with alchemy and elements.</li>
    </ul>
