    <h1>Belief in Elarion: The Philosophy of Essence</h1>

    <h2>The One Shared Truth</h2>
    <p>Across Elarion, nearly everyone agrees on one fundamental fact: An Essence permeates all things - living beings,
        stone, air, magic, even time itself.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Magic is not a miracle</strong> - it is the shaping of Essence. No one agrees on what that means.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The Verdant is not evil, good, or divine</strong> - it is Essence made willful.</li>
        <li><strong>Dragons may or may not exist</strong> - if they do, they may simply understand Essence better than
            anyone else.</li>
        <li>Everything else is interpretation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Essence as Philosophy, Not Faith</h2>
    <p>Beliefs in Elarion answer questions, not prayers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Should Essence be shaped?</li>
        <li>Should it be restrained?</li>
        <li>Is the Verdant a correction or a catastrophe?</li>
        <li>Is progress defiance or destiny?</li>
        <li>Does Essence care?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are regional schools of thought, not universal religions.</p>

    <h2>Major Philosophical Currents</h2>
    <p>These are worldviews, not churches. They overlap, fracture, and contradict each other.</p>

    <h3>1. The Essence as a Tool</h3>
    <p><em>"A river exists to be crossed."</em></p>
    <p><strong>Belief:</strong> Essence exists to be shaped, refined, and improved upon. Magic is labor. Progress is
        proof.</p>
    <p><strong>Common Among:</strong> Humans (especially artificers and builders), Forged, War-focused cultures.</p>
    <p><strong>View of the Verdant:</strong> A hostile phenomenon - a mistake, an enemy, or a natural disaster to be
        overcome.</p>
    <p><strong>Role in Play:</strong> Justifies risky magic, encourages innovation, creates escalation with nature.</p>

    <h3>2. The Essence as a Balance</h3>
    <p><em>"Push too hard, and the world pushes back."</em></p>
    <p><strong>Belief:</strong> Essence flows in cycles. Shaping it too forcefully causes backlash - the Verdant is
        evidence.</p>
    <p><strong>Common Among:</strong> Elves, Half-orcs, Some halfling tribes, Rural survivors.</p>
    <p><strong>View of the Verdant:</strong> Not evil - a response.</p>
    <p><strong>Role in Play:</strong> Encourages restraint, supports rituals and traditions, explains why resurrection
        is rare and dangerous.</p>

    <h3>3. The Essence as Indifferent</h3>
    <p><em>"The river does not know your name."</em></p>
    <p><strong>Belief:</strong> Essence has no will, no judgment, no morality. Magic works. Consequences happen. That’s
        all.</p>
    <p><strong>Common Among:</strong> Scholars, Some dwarves, Gnomes (quietly), Cynics and veterans.</p>
    <p><strong>View of the Verdant:</strong> Neither punishment nor protector - just a phenomenon.</p>
    <p><strong>Role in Play:</strong> Rationalizes brutal choices, encourages exploration and study, often clashes with
        moral arguments.</p>

    <h3>4. The Essence as Sacred</h3>
    <p><em>"You don't carve your name into a living thing."</em></p>
    <p><strong>Belief:</strong> Essence deserves reverence, not exploitation. Magic is a violation unless done with
        permission or humility.</p>
    <p><strong>Common Among:</strong> Verdant sympathizers, Orcs, Forest elves, Isolated communities.</p>
    <p><strong>View of the Verdant:</strong> A guardian, a purifier, or even a last defense.</p>
    <p><strong>Role in Play:</strong> Generates ideological conflict, creates sanctified zones, explains hostility to
        floating cities.</p>

    <h3>5. The Essence as a Lie</h3>
    <p><em>"The world wants us weak."</em></p>
    <p><strong>Belief:</strong> Essence is a trap - a system that enforces limits. Only by dominating it completely can
        mortals be free.</p>
    <p><strong>Common Among:</strong> Bastion Noctis war-mages, The Lich and his followers, Extremists and radicals.</p>
    <p><strong>View of the Verdant:</strong> A jailer.</p>
    <p><strong>Role in Play:</strong> Antagonist philosophy, explains dark magic and necromancy, justifies atrocities.
