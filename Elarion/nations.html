    <h1>Geography and Nations</h1>

    <h2>The Three Floating Cities</h2>
    <p>
        Evolved from the surviving districts of human civilization, these are the primary safe havens.
    </p>

    <h3>Aeloria (The High Capital)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Origin:</strong> The central district of Aelorium.<br>
        The seat of political power and magic. A massive city floating highest of all. It houses the Great Library
        (salvaged books) and the Council of Mages.
    </p>

    <h3>Stratus (The Vertical City)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Origin:</strong> The upper districts of Highcliff.<br>
        A city of bridges and verticality, floating on constant updrafts. It is the hub of the airship navy and trade.
    </p>

    <h3>Sanctum (The Gilded Ark)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Origin:</strong> A new construction, funded by the wealth of Meridia.<br>
        The merchant capital. Since Meridia could not be lifted, its richest families pooled their resources to build
        this flying fortress of commerce. It is crowded, wealthy, and politically cutthroat.
    </p>

    <h2>The Green Graves (The Surface)</h2>
    <p>
        The land below is claimed by nature and aggressive fauna. Permanent settlement is impossible due to the hive
        mind.
        It is a place of ruins and danger.
    </p>

    <h3>The Rustgarden (Formerly Ferrumhold)</h3>
    <p>
        Industrial ruins utterly consumed by iron-hard vines. The construct factories are silent, but feral
        <strong>Forged</strong> and metallic beasts roam here.
        Scavengers come for raw adamantine but rarely return.
    </p>

    <h3>The Drowned City (Formerly Meridia)</h3>
    <p>
        The river delta flooded, turning the city into a gold-filled swamp. Dangerous aquatic predators lurk in the
        submerged guildhalls.
    </p>

    <h3>The Silent Bastion (Formerly Solgard)</h3>
    <p>
        The military academy is now a training ground for the hive mind's most dangerous beasts.
        The magical wards that once repelled monsters now trap them inside, creating an ecosystem of nightmares.
    </p>

    <h3>The White Tomb (Formerly Lux)</h3>
    <p>
        The city of law is perfectly preserved by moss and white flowers. It is eerily quiet.
        Those who enter start to lose their will to leave, eventually becoming part of the "peaceful" garden.
    </p>

    <h3>The Smoglands (Formerly Vostro)</h3>
    <p>
        The smog never lifted; it just mixed with spores. A toxic wasteland where mutated nature rules.
        The Lich's Dominion is trying to expand here to recover necromantic artifacts.
    </p>

    <h3>Nordgard's Remnant</h3>
    <p>
        The surface city is destroyed and overgrown, but the <strong>Railway</strong> tunnel entrance is sealed and
        heavily guarded.
        The human survivors retreated <em>into</em> the mountains with the dwarves, creating a cramped, shared district
        within the dwarven hold.
    </p>

    <h2>Elven Ruins and Wild Paths</h2>

    <h3>The Crystal Ruin (Sylvaris)</h3>
    <p>Overgrown with crystal-eating vines. High Elves view it as a holy site they can no longer touch.</p>

    <h3>The Mirror-Mere (Elondria)</h3>
    <p>The lake is now a portal to the Feywild (or plane of beasts). Teleportation magic is erratic here.</p>

    <h3>The Nomad Paths</h3>
    <p>Halflings and Forest Elves now use "Sky-Lines" (air currents) or dangerous surface routes between these ruins,
        never staying in one place.</p>

    <h2>Dwarven Holds</h2>
    <p>
        Enormous cities built under the mountains, guarded by powerful magic.
        Rich in Gold, Mithril, and Adamantine.
        They recently opened their gates to the refugees of Nordgard, creating a unique mixed district of smiths.
    </p>

    <h2>The Underdark</h2>
    <p>
        Home to the Drow tribes. A place of dark pacts and creature binding.
    </p>

    <h2>The Lich's Dominion</h2>
    <p>
        A nation mainly composed of goblinoids, ruled by a Lich (a corrupted elf).
        This is the only territory on the plane not conquered by nature, because all nature within is dead.
        The Lich teaches necromancy to his subjects. For every goblin or animal that dies, more undead are created.
        It does not expand much, but neither does it shrink.
    </p>

    <h2>The World Before the Green Tide</h2>
    <p>
        Before the verdant reclamation, Elarion was a world of sprawling civilization, powerful magic, and industrial
        progress.
        Below are the major locations that defined that era, many of which are now lost, reclaimed, or transformed.
    </p>

    <h3>The 8 Major Human Cities</h3>
    <p>Humans were masters of creation, destruction, and gravity. Their cities reflected this dominance.</p>

    <h4>1. Aelorium (The Spire of Heavens)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Gravity & Magic Research.<br>
        The capital of arcane study. Dominated by tall, impossible spires held together by early gravity magic.
        It was here that the secrets of true flight and floating were unlocked.
        It is said the central district was lifted whole to become one of the current Floating Cities.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Ferrumhold (The Iron Heart)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Creation & Industry.<br>
        A city of smog, metal, and constant noise. This massive industrial hub is where the <strong>Forged</strong> were
        first given life.
        The city was a fortress of factories, churning out weapons, constructs, and technological marvels.
        Now, it is a rust-choked ruin overgrown by particularly hardy iron-vine plants.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Solgard (The Sun Bastion)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Destruction & Military Power.<br>
        Located on the eastern coast, Solgard was the shield of humanity. Its military academy was legendary.
        The mages here specialized in destructive evocation to repel sea monsters and rival nations.
        It is now a crumbling ruin, its walls breached by massive root systems.
    </p>

    <h4>4. Meridia (The Gilded Port)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Trade & Wealth.<br>
        The economic center of the human kingdoms. A sprawling metropolis on a river delta. It was known for its "bridge
        of a thousand arches."
        Half-elves were common here, facilitating trade with other races.
        The river is now a swamp, and the gold of Meridia is buried under mud and moss.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Highcliff (The Windy Aerie)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Wind & Elevation.<br>
        Built into the vertical walls of a massive canyon system. Humans here experimented with gliders and wind
        currents before gravity magic was perfected.
        It was a perilous, breathtaking city of bridges and hanging platforms.
    </p>

    <h4>6. Lux (The Beacon of Order)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Law & Light.<br>
        A city of white stone and strict laws. It was the judicial center of the region. The architecture was
        symmetrical and pristine.
        It is said that the order of Lux was an affront to the chaos of the wild, and it was one of the first to fall to
        the animal hive mind.
    </p>

    <h4>7. Vostro (The Shadow of Progress)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Ambition & The Taboo.<br>
        A secluded city where unethical or dangerous research was conducted (necromancy precursors, binding, etc.).
        It was always shrouded in unnatural smog. Rumors say some who stayed behind didn't die, but changed.
    </p>

    <h4>8. Nordgard (The Anvil of the North)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Smithing & Alliance.<br>
        A small, fortified city in the northern mountains, close to a major Dwarven settlement.
        It was unique for its deep commercial and craft alliance with the dwarves.
        Here, humans shaped the mithral and adamantine provided by the dwarves into the most beautiful and powerful
        magic weapons and armor.
        A railway connected it to the wider world, a marvel of engineering that transported these legendary goods.
    </p>

    <h3>Major Elven Locations</h3>

    <h4>High Elves</h4>

    <h5>Sylvaris (The White Sanctum)</h5>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Preservation & High Magic.<br>
        A city of crystal spires and marble, built not to conquer nature but to perfect it. It housed the largest
        library of planar magic.
        The elves here were somewhat isolationist, believing themselves the guardians of "true" magic.
    </p>

    <h5>Elondria (The Star-Mirror)</h5>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Astronomy & Teleportation.<br>
        Built around a massive, calm lake that reflected the stars perfectly. This was the hub of the teleportation
        network.
        High Elves here studied the cosmos and the planes, constructing gates that allowed instant travel between holds.
    </p>

    <h4>Forest Elves</h4>

    <h5>Vilen-Hale (The Wandering Grove)</h5>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Nature & Movement.<br>
        Less a city and more a massive, migratory collection of living treants and wagons. Even before the event, this
        clan moved with the seasons.
        They are the most adapted to the current world.
    </p>

    <h5>River-Imris</h5>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Water & Stealth.<br>
        A settlement built entirely on the massive river deltas, hidden by mists. The elves here were masters of water
        magic and stealth, using the river to move unseen.
    </p>

    <h5>Root-Haven</h5>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Ancestry & Growth.<br>
        Built within the hollowed roots of a mountain-sized tree (The Elder Pine). It was a place of deep spiritual
        significance, where resurrection rituals were perfected.
    </p>

    <h3>Major Dwarven Locations</h3>

    <h4>Thar-Kuldur (The Adamant Fastness)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Defense & Military.<br>
        The primary capital. A fortress carved directly into the bedrock of the highest peak. Its gates are solid
        Adamantine.
        It is said to be impregnable, even by the verdant tide, though its surface entrances are lost.
    </p>

    <h4>Mithral-Hall</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Wealth & Artistry.<br>
        Famous for its glittering veins of Mithril. The dwarves here were artists, creating jewelry and light armor.
        The halls were lit by glowing gems.
    </p>

    <h4>Grim-Batol (The Deep Prison)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Containment & Secrets.<br>
        A hold specifically designed to embrace the dark roots of the earth. Here, dwarves studied things found deep
        down.
        Heavily guarded and secretive.
    </p>

    <h3>Other Major Locations</h3>

    <h4>Orcs: Gromar's Reach (The Primal Circle)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Druidic Power & Transformation.<br>
        An open-air circle of massive standing stones in the heart of the old forest. Here, orcs mastered shapeshifting.
        It was a place of peace where all races were welcome if they respected nature.
    </p>

    <h4>Halflings: The Rolling Plains (Nomad's Rest)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Gathering & Trade.<br>
        Not a permanent city, but a massive seasonal gathering spot on the central plains.
        Every solstice, all halfling tribes met here to trade, share news, and race their riding beasts (giant wondrous
        birds and land mounts).
    </p>

    <h4>Gnomes: Whistle-Down (The Hidden Burrow)</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Theme:</strong> Illusion & Information.<br>
        A settlement that technically didn't exist on any map. Hidden entirely by massive illusion spells.
        It was the hub of spies and information brokers. Entrance was only possible if invited.
