    <h1>Geography and Nations</h1>

    <h2>Floating Cities</h2>
    <p>
        Thanks to human mastery of gravity, three major floating cities and many smaller floating settlements exist.
        These are the primary safe havens from the nature-claimed surface.
        All powers who own a flight of airships operate from here.
    </p>

    <h2>The Surface (The Forest)</h2>
    <p>
        Claimed by nature and aggressive fauna. Permanent settlement is impossible due to attacks by the animal hive
        mind.
        Only small, temporary camps are allowed.
        Forest elves live here in moving encampments.
        Halflings travel through here as nomads.
    </p>

    <h2>Dwarven Holds</h2>
    <p>
        Enormous cities built under the mountains, guarded by powerful magic.
        Rich in Gold, Mithril, and Adamantine.
    </p>

    <h2>The Underdark</h2>
    <p>
        Home to the Drow tribes. A place of dark pacts and creature binding.
    </p>

    <h2>The Lich's Dominion</h2>
    <p>
        A nation mainly composed of goblinoids, ruled by a Lich (a corrupted elf).
        This is the only territory on the plane not conquered by nature, because all nature within is dead.
        The Lich teaches necromancy to his subjects. For every goblin or animal that dies, more undead are created.
        It does not expand much, but neither does it shrink.
