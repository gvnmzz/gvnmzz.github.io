</U><font size="5">FEATS<br>
<br>
PREREQUISITES<br>
</font><font size="3">Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill, base attack bonus, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.<br>
A character can't use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.<br>
</font><font size="5"><br>
TYPES OF FEATS<br>
</font><font size="3">Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are item creation feats, which allow spellcasters to create magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and cast a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell were a higher spell level than it actually is.<br>
<br>

FEAT DESCRIPTIONS<br>
</font><font size="3">
<br>
<B>Armor Proficiency (Heavy) (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Armor Proficiency (light), Armor Proficiency (medium).<br>
    If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you take the respective armor penality on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you take the respective armor penality on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.
</p>

<B>Armor Proficiency (Medium) (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Armor Proficiency (light).<br>
    If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you take the respective armor penality on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.
</p>

<B>Augment Summoning (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Spell Focus (conjuration).<br>
    Each creature you conjure with any <I>summon </I>spell gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution for the duration of the spell that summoned it.
</p>

<B>Blind Fight (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    In melee, every time you miss because of concealment, you can reroll your attack one time to see if you actually hit.<br>
    invisible attacker advantages do still apply for ranged attacks, however.<br>
    <I>Special:</I> The Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a <I>blink </I>spell.<br>
</p>

<B>Brew Potions (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> Spellcraft 3<br>
    You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Brewing a potion takes one day. The base price of a potion is its spell level x (2 x spell level - 1) x 50 gp. To brew a potion, you must use up raw materials costing one half this base price.<br>
    When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.<br>
    Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component when creating the potion.<br>
</p>

<B>Cleave (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Str 13, Power Attack.<br>
    If you deal a creature enough damage to make it drop (typically by dropping it to below 0 hit points or killing it), you get an immediate, extra melee attack against another creature within reach. You cannot move before making this extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the same bonus as the attack that dropped the previous creature. You can use this ability once per round.<br>
</p>

<B>Cleave, Great (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Str 13, Power Attack, Cleave.<br>
    This feat works like Cleave, except that there is no limit to the number of times you can use it per round.<br>
</p>


<B>Combat Expertise (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <I>Prerequisites:</I> Int 13.<br>
        When you use the attack action in melee, you can take a penalty of as much as &#150;5 on all your attack rolls and add the same number (+5 or less) as a dodge bonus to your Armor Class. The changes to attack rolls and Armor Class last until your next action or reaction.<br>
</p>

<B>Combat Reflexes (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    A character with the <I>Combat Reflexes</I> skill can interrupt another character's turn if:
    <ul>
        <li>they wield a melee weapon and the other character moves out of their reach</li>
        <li>they wield a melee weapon and the other character makes a ranged attack (either spell or weapon)</li>
    </ul><br>
    A character that interrupts another character's turn can make a single melee attack against the other character. This attack interrupts the other character's movement or action, occurring right before the other character leaves their reach or completes their action. Doing so uses up the character's action for this round. After the action is resolved, the acting character completes their turn, and the interrupting character is left with just their movement.<br>
</p>

<B>Counterspell (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    A character with the <I>Counterpsell</I> skill can interrupt another character's turn to counterspell a spell that is being cast.
They roll a <I>spellcraft</I> check to see if they know the spell, and can then proceed to counterspell as explained in the "Counterspelling" section. Doing so uses up the character's action for this round. After the action is resolved, the acting character completes their turn, and the interrupting character is left with just their movement.<br>
</p>

<B>Craft Magic Arms and Armors (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> Spellcraft 5<br>
    You can create any magic weapon, armor, or shield whose prerequisites you meet. Enhancing a weapon, suit of armor, or shield takes one day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its magical features. To enhance a weapon, suit of armor, or shield, you must use up raw materials costing one-half of this total price.<br>
    The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost.<br>
    You can also mend a broken magic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first place.
</p>

<B>Craft Rod (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> Spellcraft 9<br>
    You can create any rod whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a rod takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a rod, you must use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price.<br>

</p>

<B>Craft Staff (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> Spellcraft 12<br>

</p>

<B>Craft Wand (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> Spellcraft 5<br>
    You can create a wand of any 4th-level or lower spell that you know. Crafting a wand takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a wand is its caster level x the spell level x 750 gp. To craft a wand, you must use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price. A newly created wand has 50 charges.<br>
    Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the cost derived from the base price, you must expend fifty copies of the material component.
</p>

<B>Craft Wondrous Item (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> Spellcraft 3<br>
    You can create any wondrous item whose prerequisites you meet. Enchanting a wondrous item takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its price. To enchant a wondrous item, you must use up raw materials costing half of this price.<br>
    You can also mend a broken wondrous item if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first place.<br>
    Some wondrous items incur extra costs in material components, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the item's base price. You must pay such a cost to create an item or to mend a broken one.<br>
</p>

<B>Deflect Arrows (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Dex 13.<br>
    You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not surprised.<br>
    Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons and ranged attacks generated by spell effects can't be deflected.<br>
</p>

<B>Dodge (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Dex 13.<br>

    You can also mend a broken ring if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to forge that ring in the first place.<br>
    Some magic rings incur extra costs in material components, as noted in their descriptions. You must pay such a cost to forge such a ring or to mend a broken one.
</p>

<B>Improved Critical (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> skill score 8 in the selected weapon.<br>
    When using the weapon you selected, your threat range is doubled.<br>
    <I>Special:</I> You can gain Improved Critical multiple times. The effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.<br>
    This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the Critical Hit range of a weapon.<br>
</p>

<B>Improved Disarm (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">

    Improved familiars otherwise use the rules for regular familiars<I>, </I>with two exceptions: If the creature's type is something other than animal, its type does not change; and improved familiars do not gain the ability to speak with other creatures of their kind (although many of them already have the ability to communicate).
</p>

<B>Feint (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Int 13, Combat Expertise.<br>

<B>Precise Shot, Improved (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot.<br>
    When you use a weapon that has a skill score higher than 11, your ranged attacks ignore the AC bonus granted to targets by anything less than total cover, and the miss chance granted to targets by anything less than total concealment. Total cover and total concealment provide their normal benefits against your ranged attacks.<br>
</p>

<B>Improved Sunder (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>

    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot.<br>
    When you use a weapon that has a skill score higher than 6, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet. Both arrows use the same attack roll (with disadvantage) to determine success and deal damage normally<br>
    For every five points you have in your weapon skill above +6, you may add one additional arrow to this attack. However, each arrow after the second adds a cumulative &#150;2 penalty on the attack roll.<br>
    Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired.<br>
    <I>Special:</I> Regardless of the number of arrows you fire, you apply precision-based damage only once. If you score a critical hit, only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal regular damage.<br>
</p>

<B>Mobile (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Dex 13, Dodge.<br>

    <B>Prerequisite:</B> Str 13.<br>
    <B>Benefit:</B> On your action, before making attack rolls for a round, you may choose to subtract a number from all melee attack rolls and add the same number to all melee damage rolls. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage apply until your next turn.<br>
    <B>Special:</B> If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands, instead add twice the number subtracted from your attack rolls. You can't add the bonus from Power Attack to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with unarmed strikes or natural weapon attacks), even though the penalty on attack rolls still applies.
</p>

<B>Precise Shot (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <B>Prerequisite:</B> Point Blank Shot.<br>

</p>

<B>Rapid Reload (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <B>Benefit:</B> Choose a tipe of crossbow (hand, light, heavy). You ignore the Loading property of hand crossbow and light crossbow, while you can make an additional attack with a heavy crossbow, if you skill score allows it.<br>
</p>

<B>Rapid Shot (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <B>Prerequisite:</B> Dex 13, Point Blank Shot.<br>
    <B>Benefit:</B> You can get one extra attack per round with a ranged weapon. The attack is at your highest attack bonus, but each attack you make in that round (the extra one and the normal ones) takes a &#150;2 penalty.<br>
</p>

<B>Scribe Scroll (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> Spellcraft 1<br>
    You can create a scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a scroll is its spell level x its caster level x 25 gp. To scribe a scroll, you must use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.<br>
    Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component when scribing the scroll.
</p>

<B>Shield Proficiency (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    If you wear a shield and you lack proficiency with it, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.
</p>

<B>Snatch Arrows (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <B>Prerequisite:</B> Dex 15, Deflect Arrows.<br>
    <B>Benefit:</B> When using the Deflect Arrows feat you may catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it. Thrown weapons can immediately be thrown back at the original attacker (even though it isn't your turn) or kept for later use.<br>
    You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.<br>    
</p>

<B>Spell Focus</B> (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>

    Choose a school of magic. Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against spells from the school of magic you select.<br>

</p>

<B>Spell Focus, Greater (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Spell Focus.<br>
    Choose a school of magic to which you already have applied the Spell Focus feat. Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against spells from the school of magic you select. This bonus stacks with the bonus from Spell Focus.
</p>

<B>Spell Penetration (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisites:</I> Spell Focus.<br>

</p>

<B>Spell Penetration, Greater (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>

<B>Stunning Fist (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> Dex 13, Wis 13, Unarmed Strike [8].<br>
    You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your Unarmed Strike score + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your next action). A stunned character can't take actions or reactions, automatically fails any Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls against them have advantage. You may attempt a stunning attack no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead and incorporeal creatures cannot be stunned.<br>
    <I>Fatigue:</I> when you use Stunning Fist, you roll a d20 and if the result is higher than your Unarmed Strike score, you suffer non-lethal damage equal to your Unarmed Damage skill score. If your non-lethal damage ever becomes equal to your current hit points, you gain one level of exhaustion. If it goes over you current hit points you fall unconscious. If you use this skill while you already have levels of exhaustion, you roll one additional d20 to determine if you get non-lethal damage, and you may incur in non-lethal damage multiple times.
</p>

<B>Tower Shield Proficiency (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> Shield Proficiency.<br>
    If you wear a shield and you lack proficiency with it, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.
</p>

<B>Two-weapon Defense (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> Dex 15, Two-Weapon Fighting.<br>
    When wielding a double weapon or two weapons (not including natural weapons or unarmed strikes), you gain a +1 shield bonus to your AC. If during your turn you don't make any attack, your bonus increases to +2 until you make an attack or until the beginning of your next turn.
</p>

<B>Two Weapon Fighting (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">

    When you fight with another weapon in the off-hand and you can make more than 1 attack with the primary hand, you can also do other attacks with the off hand, provided your skill allows it.
    For example if the skill with the wapon in the primary hand is 8, you can make two attacks with your primary hand +8/+3 and if your skill with the off hand is at least 6, you can also make two attacks with the off hand +6/+1.
</p>

<B>Two Weapon Fighting, Greater (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> <br>
