        SUPERNATURAL SKILLS<br>
    </font>
    <font size="3">
        Supernatural skills are magical in nature. They may come from a mystical source, drawing power from ancient
        rites, celestial beings, or the very essence of the universe. These skills might be bestowed by a deity, granted
        as part of a divine favor, or channeled through a deep connection with the natural world.
        Supernatural skills generally cost more Experience Rolls than Ordinary Skills. As for Extraordinary skills,
        there are two types of Supernatural skills:<br>

        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
            &#149; Skills that grow in Power as your skill score increase: they can be increased exactly like Ordinary
            skills, but when your skill score increases your options or the power of the skill increases. The skill
            score might be used to calculate something about your power, but it is not the exact number you will be
            using while using that skill.<br>
            &#149; Skills that increase your options just for this once. They don't have a score or a key ability
            associated. They are just one-time skills that you can have or not. They are represented with a dot after
            the black circle (&#9210;&#9210;<B>.</B>)</p>

        <B>Countersong (&#9210;&#9210;.) </B>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
            <I>Prerequisite: </I> (&#9210;) Perform [3]<br>
            You can use music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply
            have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, you make a Perform check. Any creature within 30
            feet of you (including yourself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use
            your Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform
            check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect
            of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the
            effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use your Perform check result for the save.
            Countersong has no effect against effects that don't allow saves. You may keep up the countersong for 10
            rounds.<br>
            While using this ability you cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls),
            spell trigger (such as wands), or command word.<br>
            <br>
            To use this skill, make a skill check (d20 + Skill Score).<br>
            <B>Success (Roll <= Skill Score):</B> Effect works as described.<br>
                    <B>Failure (Roll > Skill Score):</B> Action wasted. No effect.
        </p>

        <B>Fascinate (&#9210;) </B>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">

            <I>Prerequisite: </I> (&#9210;) Perform [3]<br>
            You can use music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become charmed with him. Each creature to be
            charmed must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear you, and able to pay attention to you. You must also be
            able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from
            working. For every three points this skill attains beyond 1st, you can target one additional creature.<br>
            To use the ability, you make a Perform check. Your check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will
            save against the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, you cannot attempt to fascinate that
            creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song,
            taking no other actions, for as long as you continue to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of rounds as
            your skill score). While charmed this way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0. Any potential
            threat requires you to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC
            equal to the new Perform check result.<br>
            Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the
            target, automatically breaks the effect. <I>Fascinate </I>is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting
            ability. <br>
            While using this ability you cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls),
            spell trigger (such as wands), or command word.<br>
            <br>
            To use this skill, make a skill check (d20 + Skill Score).<br>
            <B>Success (Roll <= Skill Score):</B> Effect works as described.<br>
                    <B>Failure (Roll > Skill Score):</B> Action wasted. No effect.
        </p>

        <B>Familiar (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;) </B>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
            A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service. It
            retains the appearance and skills the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast
            instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified
            animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.<br>
            A familiar also grants special abilities to its master, as given on the table below. These special abilities
            apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.<br>

            Familiar Basics: </B>Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar's kind, but make the
        following<br>
        changes:<br>
        <I>Hit Dice: </I>For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the skill score or the familiar's
        normal HD total, whichever is higher.<br>
        <I>Hit Points: </I>The familiar has one-half the master's total hit points (not including temporary hit points),
        rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.<br>
        <I>Attacks: </I>The skill score in the familiar weapons is half the master' skill score in the Familiar skill.
        Use the familiar's Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the familiar's melee attack
        bonus with natural weapons.<br>
        Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind.<br>
        <I>Saving Throws: </I>For each saving throw, use either the familiar's saving throw skills or the master's,
        whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the other
        bonuses that the master might have on saves.<br>
        <I>Ordinary Skills: </I>For each ordinary skill in which either the master or the familiar has score greter than
        0, use either the normal skill score for an animal of that type or the master's skill score, whichever are
        better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar's total skill
        modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar's ability to use.<br>
        <B>Familiar Ability Descriptions: </B>All familiars have special abilities depending on the master's Familiar
        skill score. The abilities given on the table are cumulative. <br>
        <I>Natural Armor Adj.: </I>The number noted here is an improvement to the familiar's existing natural armor
        bonus.<br>
        <I>Int: </I>The familiar's Intelligence score.<br>
        <I>Alertness (Ex): </I>While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master gains the +2 to Perception.<br>
        <I>Improved Evasion (Ex): </I>When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half
        damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving
        throw fails.<br>
        <I>Share Spells: </I>
        A master can cast spells on its familiar even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the familiar's
        type (magical beast).<br>
        <I>Empathic Link: </I>The master has an empathic link with his familiar out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The
        master cannot see through the familiar's eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited
        nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.<br>
        Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar
        does.<br>
        <I>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </I>A familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar
        are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the
        &#147;toucher.&#148; The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As usual, if the
        master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.<br>
        <I>Speak with Master: </I>A familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common
        language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.<br>
        <I>Speak with Animals of Its Kind: </I>A familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as
        itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and
        ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with amphibians, weasels with similar creatures
        (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks, wolverines, and badgers). Such communication is limited by the
        intelligence of the conversing creatures.<br>
        <I>Spell Resistance: </I>A familiar gains spell resistance equal to the skill score + 5. To affect the familiar
        with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on the spell skill check (1d20 + skill score for that spell)
        that equals or exceeds the familiar's spell resistance.<br>
        <I>Scry on Familiar: </I>The master may scry on his familiar (as if casting the <I>scrying </I>spell). They
        compare their roll with the Familiar skill score<br>

        You can use music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see
        you, and you be able to see the ally.<br>
        The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to
        hear your music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as you concentrate, up to
        a maximum of 2 minutes. You can't inspire competence in Yourself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting
        ability.<br>
        While using this ability you cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls),
        spell trigger (such as wands), or command word.<br>

    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">

        <I>Prerequisite: </I> (&#9210;) Perform [3]<br>
        You can use song or poetics to inspire courage in your allies (including yourself), bolstering them against fear
        and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear you sing. The effect lasts
        for as long as the ally hears you sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus
        on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. When
        you skill score reaches 8, and every six points thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8, +3 at 14t, and
        +4 at 20). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.<br>
        While using this ability you cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls),
        spell trigger (such as wands), or command word.<br>
        <br>
        To use this skill, make a skill check (d20 + Skill Score).<br>
        <B>Success (Roll <= Skill Score):</B> Effect works as described.<br>
                <B>Failure (Roll > Skill Score):</B> Action wasted. No effect.

    <B>Inspire Greatness (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.) </B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">

        <I>Prerequisite: </I> (&#9210;) Perform [12]<br>
        You can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in yourself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting
        them extra fighting capability. To inspire greatness, You must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect
        lasts for as long as the ally hears you sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness
        gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution
        modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on
        Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit
        Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.<br>
        While using this ability you cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls),
        spell trigger (such as wands), or command word.<br>
        <br>

        To use this skill, make a skill check (d20 + Skill Score).<br>
        <B>Success (Roll <= Skill Score):</B> Effect works as described.<br>
                <B>Failure (Roll > Skill Score):</B> Action wasted. No effect.

    <B>Inspire Heroics (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.) </B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">

        <I>Prerequisite: </I> (&#9210;) Perform [18]<br>
        You can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in yourself or a single willing ally within 30 feet.
        To inspire heroics, you must sing and an ally must hear you sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains
        a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears
        the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        To use this skill, make a skill check (d20 + Skill Score).<br>
        <B>Success (Roll <= Skill Score):</B> Effect works as described.<br>
                <B>Failure (Roll > Skill Score):</B> Action wasted. No effect.

    <B>Timeless Body (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">You no longer take ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any
        penalties you may have already incurred, however, remain in place.
    </p>

    <B>Trackless Step (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;"> You leave no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. You may choose to
        leave a trail if so desired.
    </p>

    <B>Turn Undead (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;) </B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">When you turn, you present your holy symbol and all undead creatures that can see you
        make a Will saving throw against a DC equal to 10 + half your skill score. If they fail the saving throw they
        are turned. Turned undead flee from you by the best and fastest means available to them. They flee for 10 rounds
        (1 minute). If they cannot flee, they cower (giving any attack rolls against them advantage). If you approach
        within 10 feet of them, however, they overcome being turned and act normally. You can attack them with ranged
        attacks (from at least 10 feet away), and others can attack them in any fashion, without breaking the turning
        effect.<br>
        If they fail the saving throw by more than 10 they are destroyed or commanded. If you choose to command undead,
        the total HD of undead you can command must be no higher than your skill score. You must use your action to give
        mental orders to commanded creatures.<br>
        To use this skill, make a skill check (d20 + Skill Score).<br>
        <B>Success (Roll <= Skill Score):</B> Undead are Turned/Destroyed/Commanded.<br>
                <B>Failure (Roll > Skill Score):</B> Action wasted. No effect.

    <B>Unarmed Strike (adamantine) (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <I>Prerequisite: </I> (&#9210;&#9210;) Unarmed Combat [16]<br>
        Your unarmed attacks are considered as adamatine weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction and
        hardness.
    </p>

    <B>Unarmed Strike (magic) (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <I>Prerequisite: </I> (&#9210;&#9210;) Unarmed Combat [4]<br>
        Your unarmed attacks are considered magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction and hardness.
    </p>

    <B>Wild Shape (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">You have the ability to turn yourse lf into any Medium animal and back again. The
        effect lasts for 1 hour per skill level or until you change back. Changing form (to animal or back) is an action
        and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the you are familiar
        with. You lose your ability to speak while in animal form because you are limited to the sounds that a normal,
        untrained animal can make, but you can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as
        her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit
        speech). The subject's creature type and subtype (if any) change to match the new form. The subject gains the
        Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and
        Charisma scores. It also gains all special attacks possessed by the form but does not gain the extraordinary
        special qualities possessed by the new form. As you skill score increases, you get multiple options for your
        wild shape, as described in the following table. Wild shaping automatically fails if you wear metal armour or
        shields. Furthermore, all damage you get in the animal form gets transferred to the true form. The animal form
        you choose cannot have more HD than your skill in Wild Shape.<br>
