SUPERNATURAL SKILLS<br>
</font><font size="3">
Supernatural skills are magical in nature. They may come from a mystical source, drawing power from ancient rites, celestial beings, or the very essence of the universe. These skills might be bestowed by a deity, granted as part of a divine favor, or channeled through a deep connection with the natural world. 
Supernatural skills generally cost more Experience Rolls than Ordinary Skills. As for Extraordinary skills, there are two types of Supernatural skills:<br>

<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
&#149; Skills that grow in Power as your skill score increase: they can be increased exactly like Ordinary skills, but when your skill score increases your options or the power of the skill increases. The skill score might be used to calculate something about your power, but it is not the exact number you will be using while using that skill.<br>
&#149; Skills that increase your options just for this once. They don't have a score or a key ability associated. They are just one-time skills that you can have or not. They are represented with a dot after the black circle (&#9210;&#9210;<B>.</B>)</p></font>

</font><font size="4">
    SKILLS DESCRIPTIONS<br>
    </font><font size="3"><br>

<B>Countersong (&#9210;&#9210;.) </B>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    <I>Prerequisite: </I> (&#9210;) Perform [3]<br>
    You can use music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, you make a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of you (including yourself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use your Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use your Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don't allow saves. You may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.<br>
    While using this ability you cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), spell trigger (such as wands), or command word.<br>
    <br>
    <I>Charisma Pool Points cost (1):</I> when you use this skill, you roll a d20 and if the result is higher than your Perform skill score, you use up one Point from your Charisma Pool. If you failed the check and there are not enough points in the Charisma Pool, you fail to use use the skill.
</p>

<B>Fascinate (&#9210;) </B>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">

    <I>Prerequisite: </I> (&#9210;) Perform [3]<br>
    You can use music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become charmed with him. Each creature to be charmed must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear you, and able to pay attention to you. You must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three points this skill attains beyond 1st, you can target one additional creature.<br>
    To use the ability, you make a Perform check. Your check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, you cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as you continue to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of rounds as your skill score). While charmed this way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0. Any potential threat requires you to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.<br>
    Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. <I>Fascinate </I>is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability. <br>
    While using this ability you cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), spell trigger (such as wands), or command word.<br>
    <br>
    <I>Charisma Pool Points cost (1):</I> when you use this skill, you roll a d20 and if the result is higher than your Perform skill score, you use up one Point from your Charisma Pool. If you failed the check and there are not enough points in the Charisma Pool, you fail to use use the skill.
</p>

<B>Familiar (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;) </B>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service. It retains the appearance and skills the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.<br>
A familiar also grants special abilities to its master, as given on the table below. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.<br>

<sup><font size="2">1</sup></font><font size="3"> A raven familiar can speak one language of its master's choice as a supernatural ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<sup></font><font size="2">2</sup></font><font size="3"> Tiny viper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<B><br>
Familiar Basics: </B>Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar's kind, but make the following<br>
changes:<br>
<I>Hit Dice: </I>For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the skill score or the familiar's normal HD total, whichever is higher.<br>
<I>Hit Points: </I>The familiar has one-half the master's total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.<br>
<I>Attacks: </I>The skill score in the familiar weapons is half the master' skill score in the Familiar skill. Use the familiar's Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the familiar's melee attack bonus with natural weapons.<br>
Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind.<br>
<I>Saving Throws: </I>For each saving throw, use either the familiar's saving throw skills or the master's, whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.<br>
<I>Ordinary Skills: </I>For each ordinary skill in which either the master or the familiar has score greter than 0, use either the normal skill score for an animal of that type or the master's skill score, whichever are better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar's total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar's ability to use.<br>
<B>Familiar Ability Descriptions: </B>All familiars have special abilities depending on the master's Familiar skill score. The abilities given on the table are cumulative. <br>
<I>Natural Armor Adj.: </I>The number noted here is an improvement to the familiar's existing natural armor bonus.<br>
<I>Int: </I>The familiar's Intelligence score.<br>
<I>Alertness (Ex): </I>While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master gains the +2 to Perception.<br>
<I>Improved Evasion (Ex): </I>When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.<br>
<I>Share Spells: </I>
A master can cast spells on its familiar even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the familiar's type (magical beast).<br>
<I>Empathic Link: </I>The master has an empathic link with his familiar out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The master cannot see through the familiar's eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.<br>
Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.<br>
<I>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </I>A familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.<br>
<I>Speak with Master: </I>A familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.<br>
<I>Speak with Animals of Its Kind: </I>A familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with amphibians, weasels with similar creatures (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks, wolverines, and badgers). Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures.<br>
<I>Spell Resistance: </I>A familiar gains spell resistance equal to the skill score + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + skill score for that spell) that equals or exceeds the familiar's spell resistance.<br>
<I>Scry on Familiar: </I>The master may scry on his familiar (as if casting the <I>scrying </I>spell). They might possibly use up Power Pool Points as if they had casted the spell, but they compare their roll with the Familiar skill score<br>

If they fail the saving throw they are turned.  Turned undead flee from you by the best and fastest means available to them. They flee for 10 rounds (1 minute). If they cannot flee, they cower (giving any attack rolls against them advantage). If you approach within 10 feet of them, however, they overcome being turned and act normally. You can attack them with ranged attacks (from at least 10 feet away), and others can attack them in any fashion, without breaking the turning effect.<br>
If they fail the saving throw by more than 10 they are destroyed or commanded. If you choose to command undead, the total HD of undead you can command must be no higher than your skill score. You must use your action to give mental orders to commanded creatures.<br>

    <I>Prerequisite: </I> (&#9210;&#9210;) Unarmed Combat [4]<br>
    Your unarmed attacks are considered magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction and hardness.
</p>

<B>Wild Shape (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">You have the ability to turn yourse lf into any Medium animal and back again. The effect lasts for 1 hour per skill level or until you change back. Changing form (to animal or back) is an action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the you are familiar with. You lose your ability to speak while in animal form because you are limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but you can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech). The subject's creature type and subtype (if any) change to match the new form. The subject gains the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also gains all special attacks possessed by the form but does not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form. As you skill score increases, you get multiple options for your wild shape, as described in the following table. Wild shaping automatically fails if you wear metal armour or shields. Furthermore, all damage you get in the animal form gets transferred to the true form. The animal form you choose cannot have more HD than your skill in Wild Shape.<br>
