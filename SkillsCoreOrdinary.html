</U><font size="5">SKILLS SUMMARY<br>
<br></font><font size="3">
All skills are represented as (&#9210;...) skill name [n]. The number of &#9210; indicates how many Experience Rolls the skill costs and it is variable. Learning or improving the use of a longsword costs (&#9210;), while learning or improving a <I>fireball</I> spell costs (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;).<br>
The number between square brakets indicates the skill score, serving different purposes depending on the skill. Skill scores generally range from 0 (untrained) to 20 (expert), but may exceed 20. Some skills, though, are not increaseable. This is noted with a dot after their cost, e.g. (&#9210;&#9210;.) <br>
<br></font><font size="4">
SKILL ADVANCEMENT<br>
</font><font size="3">
At the end of each session, or at any point during the session in case of longer sessions, the Game Master assigns a number of Experience Rolls. You can spend these Experience Rolls between sessions to advance any skill you already know. Advancing skills that yor character does not know is up to the game master. Here are some guidelines:<br>
&#149; You can only advance a new skill if you have used it during the session; <I> Example: you don't know how to use an axe, but still you took one and used it. Then you can start learning. You usually prefer to solve things with weapons, but this time you tried to use persuasion. Then you can start learning.</I><br>
&#149; You can only advance a Extraordinary skill if you had time to learn / practice during the course of last session; <I> Example: you don't know how to sneak attack but you want to learn it. If during a session you have had access to training (or you just had time to train by yourself) then you can start learning and using this skill.</I><br>
&#149; You can only advance a Supernatural skill if you had training or a different reason in the game that granted you the ability to use that skill; <I> Example: you can only learn Wild Shape if trained by some kind of druid. Alternatively, it could be a reward. For example, you helped the druid of the forest to get rid of the necromancer that was killing all animals to make udnead pets. To reward you, the spirits of the forest granted you the ability to transform into an animal.</I><br>
&#149; You can only advance a spell you do not know if you have had training from someone who knows that spell, or if you have had access to a scroll or a spell book or if you have seen the spell being cast. In any case, learning a new spell requires a spellcraft check; <I> Example: you see someone casting a very interesting spell and decide to learn how to cast it. You make a spellcraft check to see if you recall all the gestures and wording to cast said spell. If you are successful, you can start learning.</I><br>

Advancing a skill may cost one or more Experience Rolls, and you can save Experience Rolls for a future session, for example to spend them on a more expensive skill.<br>
To advance a skill, expend the appropriate number of Experience Rolls and roll a d20:<br>
&#149; If you roll higher than your skill score, than you increase your skill by 1;<br>
&#149; If you roll lower than or equal to your skill score, the Experience Rolls are expended, but your skill score stays the same;<br>
&#149; If you roll 20, you increase your skill score even if it is already higher than 20.<br>
This means that once you get to some high level of the skill, it's going to be much harder to im- prove and you might need several sessions to reach a 20.<br>
<br>
<I>
    Example: your have </I>(&#9210;) longsword [10]<I>. You use the longsword during the session and at the end of the session you want to increase it. You roll a d20 and you get 12. You spent your Experience Roll and now your longsword skill is 11.<br>
</I><br>
<I>
    Example: your have </I>(&#9210;)<I> magic missile </I>[5]<I>. You use magic missile during the session and at the end of the session you want to increase it. You roll a d20 and you get 4. You spent your Experience Roll but you don't increase your skill score.<br>
</I><br>

<br></font><font size="5">
CORE SKILLS<br>
</font><font size="3">

Core skills are essential for character creation. Although each of them is special and unlike any other skills, they function similarly in terms of advancement.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;) Ability Score Increase:</B> Increase the desired ability score by +1.<br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    Ability scores are generated throug dice rolls or a point buy system at the beginning of the game, and can have any value up to 20. While increasing your ability scores, treat them as any other skill score. This means that increasing ability scores that are already high might prove difficult, and require multiple expenditures of Experience Rolls, while low ability score should be easier to increase.</p>    
<B>(&#9210;&#9210;) Hit Dice (HD):</B> Add 1 Hit Die and add 1d8 + Constitution modifier to Hit Points (hp).<br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    Hit Points are an abstraction signifying how robust and healthy a creature is at the current moment. To determine a creature's hit points, roll the dice indicated by its Hit Dice. A creature gains maximum hit points for its first Hit Die roll. Creatures whose first Hit Die comes from an NPC class or from his race roll their first Hit Die normally. Wounds subtract hit points, while healing (both natural and magical) restores hit points. Some abilities and spells grant temporary hit points that disappear after a specific duration. When a creature's hit points drop below 0, it becomes unconscious.<br>
    <br>
    Hit Dice also represent a character's potential for recovery. They are a resource that can be expended while resting to recover Hit Points.</p>
    <B>(&#9210;&#9210;) Dodge </B> Add +1 to Dodge. 
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        When a character is the target of an attack, it uses its Armor Class to avoid it. An Armor Class check is rolled by the character whenever they are the target of an attack.
    </p>
<B>(&#9210;&#9210;) Defence Scores:</B> Add +1 to Reflexes, Fortitude or Will. 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    When a character is the target of a dangerous spell or special effect, it uses its Defense Scores to resist or reduce the impact. These defenses are always rolled by the character whenever they are the target of an effect. There are three types of Defense Scores:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Fortitude</b> (resists poisons, diseases, and other physical afflictions),</li>
        <li><b>Reflexes</b> (resists area effects like fireballs or explosions), and</li>
        <li><b>Will</b> (resists mental manipulation and enchantment).</li>
    </ul>
</p>

</font><font size="5">
ORDINARY SKILLS<br>
</font><font size="3">
    
Ordinary skills include weapons and mundane skills. Although when brought at higher scores these skills become exceptional themselves, they are skills that everyone can train without having to go through any specific training. Each ordinary skill has an associated ability, which becomes relevant while using said skill.<br><br>

<B>Skill Score:</B> A character's score in a skill is based on how many Experience Rolls a character has invested in a skill. Ordinary skill can be used even if their score is zero.<br>
<B>Ability Modifier:</B> The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill's key ability (the ability associated with the skill's use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.<br>

</font><font size="4"><br>
    USING SKILLS<br>
    </font><font size="3">When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well he or she does. The higher the result of the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.<br>
    Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise he or she would fail.<br>
    <br>
    SKILL CHECKS<br>
    A skill check takes into account a character's training (skill score), natural talent (ability modifier), and luck (the die roll). <br>
    To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character's skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the character's score in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill's key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply. The higher the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.<br>
    <br>
    <B>Difficulty Class<br>
    </B>Some checks are made against a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC is a number (set using the skill rules as a guideline) that you must score as a result on your skill check in order to succeed.<br>

    <br>
    <B>Contests<br>
    </B>Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.<br>
    <br>
    Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.<br>
    <br>
    If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.<br>

    <br>
    ABILITY CHECKS<br>
    Sometimes a character tries to do something to which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate ability modifier. Essentially, you're making an untrained skill check. <br>
    In some cases, an action is a straight test of one's ability with no luck involved. Just as you wouldn't make a height check to see who is taller, you don't make a Strength check to see who is stronger.<br>
<br>
</font><font size="4"><br>
    SKILLS DESCRIPTIONS<br>
    </font><font size="3">This section describes each skill, including common uses and typical modifiers. Characters can sometimes use skills for purposes other than those noted here.<br><br>
        
<B>(&#9210;) Acrobatics (Dex; armor check penalty):</B> Your Acrobatics check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The GM might also call for an Acrobatics check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Appraise (Int):</B> Appraise allows you to estimate the value of objects such as gems, artwork, or magic items, as well as collections of items like gold pieces in a chest or the total worth of a dragon's hoard.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Athletics (Str; armor check penalty):</B> Athletics covers difficult situation you encounter while climbing, jumping or swimming such as climbing. Examples include the following activities:
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    &#149;You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.<br>
    &#149;You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.<br>
    &#149;You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.
</p>
<B>(&#9210;) Bondage Mastery (Dex):</B> Bondage Mastery involves skill in escaping restraints, securely binding prisoners, and adeptly utilizing ropes and bindings for various purposes.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Craft (Int):</B> Craft includes a variety of specialized skills focused on creating different items. Examples include:
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    &#149; Alchemy : Crafting potions and elixirs.<br>
    &#149; Armorsmithing : Crafting armor and protective gear.<br>
    &#149; Weaponsmithing : Crafting weapons and combat equipment.<br>
    &#149; Trapmaking : Crafting traps and snares.<br>
    &#149; Forgery : Crafting counterfeit docu- ments and items.<br>
    <br>
    The basic function of the Craft skill is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item's finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.<br>
    In some cases, the <I>fabricate </I>spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.<br>
    A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the <I>ironwood </I>spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.<br>
    When casting the spell <I>minor creation</I>, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.<br>
    All crafts require artisan's tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a &#150;2 circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan's tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.<br>
    To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.<br>
    1. Find the item's price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).<br>
    2. Find the DC from the table below.<br>
    3. Pay one-third of the item's price for the cost of raw materials.<br>
    4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week's work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result &#215; the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result &#215; the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you've completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result &#215; the DC doesn't equal the price, then it represents the progress you've made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.<br>
    If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week.<br>
    If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.<br>
    <I>Progress by the Day: </I>You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result &#215; DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.<br>
    <I>Creating Masterwork Items: </I>You can make a masterwork item&#151;a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. <I>Note: </I>The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.<br>
    <I>Repairing Items: </I>Generally, you can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item's price. 
</p>
<B>(&#9210;) Deception (Cha):</B> Deception involves convincingly concealing the truth, whether through verbal manipulation or deceptive actions. This skill applies to various situations, such as persuading a guard with clever words, swindling a merchant through deceit, winning money through gambling, disguising oneself to deceive others, easing suspicions with false assurances, maintaining composure while telling outright lies.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Intimidation (Cha):</B> Intimidation is the art of influencing others through overt threats, aggressive behavior, and displays of physical prowess. Examples include extracting information from a captive through intimidation, confronting street toughs to avoid conflict, using intimidation tactics to sway the decisions of authority figures.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Investigation (Int/Cha):</B>Investigation (Int) allows you to search for clues and make deductions based on them. You might determine the location of a hid- den object, identify the weapon used to inflict a wound based on its appearance, or locate the weakest point in a tunnel prone to collapse. Conversely, Investigation (Cha) involves gathering information through conversations with people in a town or community.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Knowledge (Int):</B> Knowledge is a number of separate skills and you can have several Knowledge skills. Knowledge represents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even scientific discipline. Below are listed typical fields of study.
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
&#149; Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)<br>
&#149; Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)<br>
&#149; Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)<br>
&#149; Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)<br>
&#149; History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)<br>
&#149; Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)<br>
&#149; Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)<br>
&#149; Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees, mottoes, personalities)<br>
&#149; Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)<br>
&#149; The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the planes)<br>
<br>
Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).<br>
In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster's HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster.<br>
</p>
<B>(&#9210;) Lockpicking (Int):</B> Lockpicking covers attempts to open locks, disable traps and devices or other general thievery. Attempting a Lockpicking check without a set of thieves' tools imposes a -2 penalty on the check, even if a simple tool is employed. The DC for opening a lock varies from 20 to 40 as given on the table below. Traps have their own DC.<br>
<br>

    </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
<B>(&#9210;) Medicine (Int/Wis):</B> A Medicine (Wis) check allows you to stabilize a dying companion or treat a wound. A Medicine (Int) check enables you to diagnose and treat diseases or poisons.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Perception (Wis):</B> Perception enables you to detect the presence of objects or creatures in your surroundings through keen observation and senses. Examples include listening in on conversations through closed doors, spotting hidden threats such as ambushes or lurking enemies, or identifying concealed objects or passageways.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Persuasion (Cha):</B> Persuasion is the art of influencing others through tact, social graces, or genuine good- will. It is used to foster friendships, negotiate peace, or inspire positive actions. Examples include convincing officials to grant an audience with the king, mediating conflicts between factions, or rallying townsfolk to a common cause.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Sense Motive (Wis):</B> Sense Motive enables you to discern the true intentions of others by interpreting subtle cues in their behavior, speech, and demeanor. This skill is used to detect lies, anticipate actions, and gauge the sincerity of individuals.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Sleight of Hand (Dex):</B> Sleight of Hand encompasses the perfor- mance of manual trickery and acts of legerdemain. This skill includes planting objects on others, concealing items on your person, lifting purses, or removing items from someone's pocket without detection.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Spellcraft (Int):</B> Use this skill to identify spells as they are cast or spells already in place. You also use this skill to decypher or learn a spell from a spellbook or a scroll, identify a potion.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Survival (Wis):</B> Survival is essential for tracking creatures, hunting game, navigating harsh environments, identifying signs of nearby creatures like owlbears, predicting weather patterns, and avoiding natural hazards such as quicksand.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Stealth (Dex):</B> Stealth involves efforts to conceal oneself from enemies, evade guards, move silently without detection, or approach targets without being seen or heard.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Use Magic Device (Int/Cha):</B> A Use Magic Device (Int) check enables you to read spells or activate magic items. If you activate an item blindly, without knowing its function, you suffer disadvantage. Conversely, a Use Magic Device (Cha) check allows you to use a magic item as if you possessed the spell or prerequisite skill, or as if you were of a different race or alignment.<br>
<br>
<B>(&#9210;) Weapons (Str/Dex):</B> Add +1 to any weapon of your choice. 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
   Every weapon is a different skill, e.g. (&#9210;) longsword, (&#9210;) shortsword, (&#9210;) longbow, etc... Weapons have different abilities associated to them depending on the type:<br>
   &#149; Melee and thrown weapons add the Strength modifier<br>
   &#149; Ranged weapons add the Dexterity modifier<br>
   &#149; Finesse melee weapons may add the Strength or Dexterity modifier<br>
   <br> Simple weapons such as (&#9210;) dagger or (&#9210;) quarterstaff are easier to learn. Whenever you spend an Experience Roll to improve them, you roll a d2 (e.g. even or odd on any dice, or flip a coin) to determine how much you increase that skill.<br>
   <br> Whenever you reach a level in a skill equal to 6, 11, 16 you can make a further attack at a cumulative -5 malus with that weapon. For example a character with skill longsword [13] and strength 17 will be able to make a first attack at +16, a second one at +11 and a third one at +6, as shown in the following table.<br>

   <br> Weapon skills interact and synergize with each other in the following way:<br>
   &#149; given your skill in a weapon, the skill in weapons of the same group is 1/2 of the skill in said weapon, if higher than the skill in the other weapons in the group (refer to the <A href="Equipment.html">equipment</a> section for the definition of weapon groups);<br>
   &#149; given your skill in a weapon, the skill in weapons of the same damage type (slashing, piercing) is 1/3 of the skill in said weapon, if higher than the skill in the other weapons with the same damage type;<br>
   &#149; given your skill in a weapon, the skill in weapons of the same type (ranged, melee, thrown) is 1/4 of the skill in said weapon, if higher than the skill in the other weapons of the same type.<br>
   <I>Exception:</I> unlike normal rounding, all the fractions here are rounded up.<br><br>
   <I>Example: if you have </I>(&#9210;) longsword [10]<I>, you'll have </I>[5]<I> in heavy blades such as the greatsword or the scimitar, you'll have </I>[4]<I> with axes or with the double sword, you'll have </I>[3]]<I> in other melee weapons such as hammers or staves, unless of course you already have more than that already.</I>
