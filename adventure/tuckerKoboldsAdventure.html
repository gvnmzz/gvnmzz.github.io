        <b>Adventure Summary</b><br><br>

        This adventure is a dungeon expedition where the characters must enter a kobold lair, recover a powerful
        artifact (the <i>Flametongue</i>), and return safely.<br><br>

        You can try this game using any adventure you want with a bit of work and adaptation. However, this book
        provides an original adventure that is already fully prepared and ready to be played.<br><br>

        You are advised to read the rules of the game first.<br><br>


        <b>What You Need to Play</b><br><br>

        To run this adventure, you need the core rules of the game, available in the System Reference Document
        (SRD).<br>
        See the rules <a href="../index.html">here</a>.<br><br>


        <b>GM Guidance</b><br><br>

        This dungeon is a big trap. It takes inspiration from Tucker's Kobolds and can be run at different power tiers.
        Here we propose a version suitable for the characters included in the adventure.<br><br>

        The entrance described here is only one of the many entrances to this lair, but it is the only one that is
        easily accessible to Medium-sized creatures. This is intentional. The kobolds want to lure the characters
        inside, where escape will be difficult. Their main goal is not to kill the intruders, but to enslave
        them.<br><br>

        There are three levels in the dungeon: the <b>Middle Level</b> is the trap level, the <b>Lower Level</b> (key D)
        is where the kobolds live and where prisoners are enslaved and eventually die, and the <b>Upper Level</b> (key
        U) is accessible only to kobolds and Small creatures. It is filled with narrow tunnels and a few chambers where
        the kobolds keep their most valuable possessions.<br><br>

        The Middle Level also contains a Dragon (of an age appropriate to the characters). The dragon believes itself to
        be the ruler of the complex, but does not realize (although it suspects) that the kobolds could easily bury it
        and dispose of it. For the kobolds, it is merely a dangerous pet guarding their treasure.<br><br>

        These kobolds are mean - meaner than the typical kobold, although they are otherwise typical in nature.
        Some of these kobolds can wield minor magic, but their power is fleeting and unreliable.<br><br>

        <b>A note on monsters stat blocks</b><br><br>
        The stat blocks of the monsters are not the final version. They are intended just a starting point, and you can
        adjust
        them to your liking. The kobolds are meaner than the typical kobold, but their power is fleeting and unreliable.
        Just go with the flow. If you feel that a Kobold should have a magic missile, so be it. If you feel that a
        kobold should be able to cast a fireball, so be it.
        The Ability DCs are intended just for that, to give the GM a number for whaterver thing you think that monster
        can do.<br><br>

        For the same reason, you can see that Defences are shown with just a copoule of numbers. If you think that a
        specific monster, or kobold specifically, is better at Will rather than Reflex or Constitution, use the higher
        number for Will and the lower for Reflex and Constitution. Dodge defence is already included in the AC, so you
        don't need to add it again.<br><br>

        <b>KEY TO THE DUNGEON</b><br>
        The squares in the map are 5 ft. and there is no light inside the complex, since the kobolds and the dragon have
        darkvision.<br><br>
        Tunnels in the Middle Level are 5 ft. wide and high, rooms are 10 ft. high.<br><br>

                <td bgcolor="#f0f0f0">
                    You have traveled across the mountains for many days. You have followed a Kobold hunting party and
                    have successfully identified the entrance to their lair. The opening is large enough for a large
                    creature to fit in. Next to the entrance, laying all curled up with its back on the wall there is a
                    little creature wrapped in fur. If they saw you, they did not show any sign of it.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table><br>

        The hunting party was actually aware of the party following them, and they have communicated so to the
        <b>kobold</b> sentinel at the entrance. The sentinel has a hidden wire they can pull to ring a bell inside the
        cave and alert of troubles coming.<br><br>

        The sentinel is crippled, and does nothing to hurt the characters. If they speak to them she tries to get some
        information, and is even helpful. The moment they talk, she already rang the bell and she accomplished her
        task.<br><br>

        If the PC attack the sentinel and she survives, she runs into corridor 3 and waits there for the characters. If
        she does not survive, read the following<br><br>

                    You hear a frightened scream coming from inside the cave, right after the entrance, and see someone

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table><br>

        If they follow him, they see that it's a <b>kobold</b> running towards the corridor in area 3.<br><br>

        Outside the cave, a few meters away from the kobold sentinel, there is a giant <b>Lizard Chameleon</b>. It stays
        still motionless (and the characters probably don't see it since it has exceptional camouflage) and it only
        hisses and attacks if the characters attack the kobold sentinel.<br><br>

        If the sentinel sounded the alarm, this room is empty. Otherwise two <b>kobolds</b> are stationed here guarding
        the entrance.<br><br>

                    The entrance room, about 15 by 20 feet, is dimly lit by the dying fire and reeks of decay. Three

                    emanating a foul stench, and one straight ahead, inviting the adventurers deeper into the kobold's

        If the <b>kobolds</b> are present they are surprised. They are outnumbered, so they try to flee, but not before
        cutting the characters way out by collapsing the trap right above the entrance by cutting a rope at the
        beginning of the tunnel leading to area 4.<br><br>

        This is yet another trap. The kobolds want to draw the characters in area 3.<br><br>

        This is a possible way out from the trap in area 4 if the characters can't manage to be pulled up there in the

                    As your party progresses through the kobold lair, they come upon a tunnel adorned with remarkable
                    bas-reliefs. These intricate carvings depict scenes of kobolds triumphing over demons, dragons, and
                    giants, showcasing their prowess in battle and their ambition for conquest. The smooth walls narrate
                    a tale of kobold ascendancy, with each panel telling a story of cunning strategies and hard-fought
                    victories.<br><br>

                    Beneath their feet, the floor is paved with meticulously laid tiles, a testament to the kobolds'
                    attention to detail. As your party moves forward, the images on the walls serve as a reminder of the
                    challenges they may face deeper within the lair, where the kobolds' determination and prowess are on
                    full display.

        This tunnel is the most dangerous trap of the whole complex. If the sentinel was alive, it run in here.
        Otherwise, one of the two kobolds in area 1 came this way. Whoever came here is sacrificing themselves, because
        if they manage to activate the trap, there is no way out and they are doomed.<br><br>

        Once the trap is activated (it's identical to the one in area 1) some smoke starts to develop from under the
        debris. It advances by 5 ft. per round. It obscures vision but even if it fills the whole tunnel it does not
        cause suffocation. It makes it easier for the kobolds to attack with surprise through the holes in the wall.
        They don't get advantage, though, because they cannot see the characters with the smoke.<br><br>

        <b>SPEAR THROUGH HOLE TRAP</b><br>
        <b>Effect:</b> Atk +5, 1d6 prc damage. Automatic recharge. There are 1d4 consecutive holes. Roll to determine
        how many characters are attacked at the same time.<br>
        <br>

        If the characters proceed, they find the tunnel going on forever, and getting always narrower and thinner and
        rougher and less decorated.<br><br>

        Characters can notice (Perception DC 15) that there are holes scattered around the walls and ceiling. The smoke
        seems to be aspirated in these holes (Perception DC 20). Through a smart ventilation system, this smoke goes
        then outside, and does not spread in the kobold tunnel.<br><br>

        The only way to get out is to blast their way out of the entrance, or break the walls in correspondence to the
        kobolds tunnels above them on the outer tunnel. Here, though, they would have to crawl while squeezing, and be
        subject to the attacks of multiple kobolds present in the tunnels.<br><br>

        Stone has a hardness of 8 (meaning it ignores the first 8 damage). The walls separating the characters from the
        kobold tunnel has 30 HP, while the collapsed entrance has 900 HP and is 5 ft deep. It takes to the full party
        one hour to free the entrance if they find a way to get rid of the smoke. Otherwise it takes 3 hours.<br><br>

        If they start doing this, the kobold may attempt the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Pour boiling oil through some hole, making the floor greasy and slippery. Every characters laying on the
                ground takes 3d6 fire damage.</li>
            <li>Prepare a barricade right in front of the entrance of the tunnel, from where 5 kobolds are going to
                throw acidic fire bombs to the characters once they get out (touch +3, 1d4 fire + 1d4 acid, and 1d4 fire
                for the next 2 rounds unless the acid is not removed - a <i>prestidigitation</i> might do the trick)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <i>DM notes:</i> This room is an opportunity to instill terror in your players. It should not debilitate them
        too much, and it might even prove a safe place to rest when they understand a few things (e.g. how to occlude
        the holes). It serves the purpose of showing how mean these kobolds are and how they toy with their preys. It
        must make the characters understand that they are not the predators here, they are the prey.<br><br>

        <u>4 - THE PIT</u><br>
        If characters hesitate to proceed, let a couple of kobolds shoot at them.<br><br>

        <table width="90%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="10">

                    This tunnel is still large enough for the party to go through it, even though it's only 5 ft. tall,
                    so creatures other than small and dwarves might not find it very comfortable, despite not having any
                    mechanical effect. It's very tortuous and it's difficult to find more than a few meters of a
                    straight line to shoot. At some point, you find yourselves on a long corridor, and two kobolds lie a
                    the end of it, shooting at you with their slings a soon as they see you.

        <b>Effect:</b> Perception DC 20 to notice. Reflex DC 15 to avoid. A creature that fails the saving throw falls
        for 20 feet in a frigid pond inhabited by a pudding. The pit is 15 ft. deep.<br>

                    like there is room for so much stuff. Three tunnels depart from this room, one in front of you,
                    although with a smaller entrance, one to the left, and one to the right.

        If the characters don't take a decision soon, the kobolds start to shoot at them through holes in the ceiling.
        These kobolds don't just shoot slings. Some of them also know some cantrips. They either shoot acid splashes, or
        ice rays or fire bolts. All deal only 1d3 damage, touch, but use the same attack of the sling.<br><br>

        These Piranhas will attack anybody that comes into the water, unless they can be convinced not to do so.<br>
        They are just famished. After eating a creature they will not attack anymore. If the characters put the corpse
        of a kobold in the pool, they can go through it undisturbed.<br>
        If the piranha don't attack, the character simply swim through the pool. Otherwise, they need a DC 12 Athletics
        check to swim through the pool.<br><br>

        These sadistic kobols build a transparent glass wall so that they can see what happens in the pool, just to
        enjoy the sight of the preys being eaten by the Piranhas. Once underwater they can be seen laughing at the
        characters.<br><br>

        <u>7 - THE GASWAY</u><br>
        The entrance of this tunnel is a bit lower than the others. Inside this tunnel, above the height of 4 feet,
        there is a poisonous gas that when inhaled make people faint. Nothing happens if the characters crawl or ar
        small in size, since they breathe at a lower height.<br><br>

        <b>POISONOUS GAS</b><br>
        <b>Effect:</b> Fort DC 13. This poison does not have color or smell, nor taste. When inhaled, you risk becoming
        unconscious for 1 minute. After 1 minute you need to make another Fort saving throw. If you fail the second one,
        you become unconscious for 2d4 hours.<br>

        Small creature can move easily through this passage going towards area 9, but if they go towards area 5 they
        consider it difficult terrain.<br><br>

        Medium creatures consider it difficult terrain going towards area 9, and if they go back towards area 5, in
        addition, they also suffer 1d4 slashing and piercing damage, no save.<br><br>

        When you consider it difficult terrain, you might move at full speed. Doing so, though, means you automatically

        Once the characters are more than halfway towards the end, from some holes in the ceiling, 2 kobolds start to
        shoot at them.<br><br>

                    This room is by far the biggest and most worked that you have encoutered. It's circular, 50 feet in
                    diameter, with a tall hemispherical ceiling 15 feet high. On the opposite side of the room, an
                    imposing wooden door seems to lead to some important room. The ceiling of the hall is dotted with a
                    hundred holes the size of a fist.

        As soon as somebody enters the room, it's clear that there are many kobolds in this room. They are whispering
        and snickering and cannot contain their excitement. When everybody is in the room, the kobolds collapse the
        entrances, trapping the characters in this room.<br><br>

        As this happens, they started attacking. They have nearly full cover, but it's very easy for them to attack the
        characters anywhere in the room.<br><br>

        There are 10 kobolds, 4 of which attack with arrows dealing 1d6-1 damage, 4 with <i>ray of frost</i>, and 2
        attack using bottles of <i>acidic fire</i> (touch +3, 1d4 fire + 1d4 acid, and 1d4 fire for the next 2 rounds
        unless the acid is not removed - a <i>prestidigitation</i> might do the trick).<br><br>

        The kobolds have nearly total cover. Consider them having 3/4 cover and attackers attack with disadvantage. They
        can still be seen, so <i>magic missile</i> still hits automatically.<br><br>

        The door can be smashed open with a DC 18 Athletics check. There are no door knobs, or locks on the door, and
        the door has 10 hit points, ignoring the first 5 from each attack (unless attacked with an adamantine
        weapon).<br><br>

        <u>D10 AND 11 - CREVASSE</u><br>
        The door from area 9 opens on a crevasse. The door is 30 feet from the bottom. If any creature is trying to
        smash the door open, make them roll a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to avoid fall in the crevasse.<br><br>

                    of you. On a platform about 10 feet below the door on the other side, a dozen of kobolds looks very
                    happy to see you. Some of them are on top of a loaded ballista, and they shoot at the first

        The characters can start strying to climb the wall, which is covered in ropes and plants that make it easy to
        climb. In the meantime, though, dozens of kobolds are shooting at the characters.<br>
        Furthermore, they notice that right 5 feet away from the door, a circle of fire surrounds them.<br><br>

        Going through the fire circle causes 1d6 fire damage. After the first fire circle, there is another one 5 feet
        away.<br><br>

        Falling causes 1d6 damage per 10 feet, and you fall prone.<br><br>

        At the bottom of the crevasse there are 10 <b>zombies</b> of different creatures, some humans, some dwarves,
        some elves, some gnomes, some halflings, you choose. Furthermore there is also 1 <b>ogre zombie</b>. Remember
        that the zombies can either attack or move. They are all spread around the crevasse, so not more than 2 or 3
        will be in the immediate vicinity of any character falling.<br>
        As soon as somebody is in the crevasse (even a kobold), the zombies will go there to eat.<br><br>

        character) they are hit by something. If they roll 1 they are hit by 2. You can then roll a d4 and depending on

        <u>12 - DRAGON'S LAIR</u><br>
        This room is home for the dragon <b>Zog</b>. Zog is a <i>red dragon wyrmling</i> that hatched not too long ago
        and and at first it was just the kobolds's pet, protecting their treasure. As it grows, though, it's starting to
        understand its own power, and claimed this room as its own, including the treasures included.<br><br>

        The kobolds were able to stash some treasure in room U19, away from the dragon, but it claimed the
        <i>flametongue</i> sword for itself.<br><br>

                    fire, which is the only source of light in the room. Many stalagmites and piles of rock are spread

        Unless the characters find a way to enter undetected, Zog notices them and hides in the pile of treasure. He
        rolled Stealth 21, so the characters don't notice it unless they roll Perception higher than that. Remember that
        Zog has blindsense, and can perceive even unseen creatures.<br>
        Zog knows he's a little dragon, but he is already full of himself. He thinks he can take the characters, and
        attacks if he can hit many of them with his breath.<br><br>

        If he perceives the characters are around but cannot see them, he tries to talk to them to understand what they
        want and if he can be of help to them. If the characters mention the <i>flametongue</i> sword, he gets really
        upset and attacks.<br><br>

        In realtiy, Zog is the hatchling of an Adult Red Dragon named Maicalepre. One day Maicalepre left and never
        returned. That's why everybody thinks something bad happened to Maicalepre, and why the Kobolds and Zog assume
        Maicalepre's treasure is now theirs.<br><br>

        <u>D13 - DRAGON'S LAIR TUNNEL</u><br>
        Through this large tunnel Maicalepre could have access to the crevasse and to get outside the mountain. Zog uses

                    walls, along with scattered belongings. However, the room is unusually quiet, with only the sound of
                    labored breathing breaking the silence. In one bed lies a sick kobold, its frail form a stark
                    contrast to the usual bustling activity of the lair.

        This is a common room for the Kobolds where normally they would be found, but this is a special occasion. Preys
        are in the complex, so all the kobolds are around, and none could be found here, but a <b>sick kobold</b> lying
        in bed. The kobold is not able to fight, and barely able to speak. It speaks draconics only.<br><br>

        From rooms D15 and D16, small and tight passages bring out of the mountain. These entrances are well hidden and
        typically closed. At each of the entrances, 2 <b>kobolds</b> stand guard and have a device to alert the complex
        like the one found outside of area 1.<br><br>

        <u>D17 - THE CANAL</u><br>
        This canal connects the pit in area 4 to the sinkholes in area 2.<br>
        It's 4 feet deep, only 1 feet remains above the water up to the ceiling. While walking towards below are 2, the
        level of the water starts to lower as the floor rises. The area right below the sinkholes has only a few inch of
        water. A small creature can easily pass through one of the sinkholes, while a medium creature needs to squeeze.
        Regardless the size, everyone passing through the sinkhole will be covered in kobold droppings. The sinkholes
        are just 10 feet from the floor.<br><br>

        <u>U18 - UPPER KILL ROOM</u><br>
        This is where the kobolds store all their weapons and their stock of acidic fire.
        They have slings, bows, shortswords, some longswords, and spears, all scattered around on the border of the
        room, i.e. the lower part. The room floor corresponds to the dome of Room 9, thus it is hemisperical, but there
        are protrudences that help the kobolds climb to the best spot and stash enough vials of acidic fire and
        projectiles for them to have fun.<br><br>

        Any explosion happening in this room makes the ceiling collapse. If the ceiling collapses, all kobolds inside
        are dead, and it causes 3d8 bludgeoning damage (DC 18 Reflex Save) to all the creatures underneath it.<br><br>

        <u>U19 - THE LABORATORY</u><br>

        acid damage to each creature in the room. The explosion causes the debris to occlude both exits, and water
        starts pouring inside. The water fills the room in 5 minutes.<br><br>

        If the character destroy the ceiling, it gives way to a natural pool inside the mountain but outside the complex

        <b>CONCLUDING THE ADVENTURE</b><br>
        This adventure can be completed in one, two or three sessions depending on how long your typical session is. It
        would be advisable to run it in multiple sessions because this gives you the opportunity to award Experience
        Rolls to the characters, potentially improving their chances. Gauge how many XR you want to award between each
        session, but a good number could be between 3 and 5. If you feel that your characters are underpowered for the
        dangers of this dungeon, you can award even 10. There is not a right answer.<br><br>

        The adventure is concluded when the characters are out of the kobolds' lair, and the dragon is slain. If the
        characters flee the kobolds won't follow them, preferring to use their resources to improve or repair their
        lair. The dragon, on the other hand, will chase the characters if they flee without having him slain, especially
        if they stole something from its treasure. This dragon is primarily driven by emotions, and it won't care about
        its own safety if he wants vengeance from the characters.<br><br>

        Thus, the character will have to overcome the challenges of the kobolds, get to the dragon's lair and fight the
        dragon to retrieve their loot, and most importantly escape the complex. Unless they find a way to shrink
        themselves, the only easy way out is the way they came in.<br><br>

        The character suggested here are focused on fighting and exploration. Your group might be more incline to tackle
        it socially. Although not likely in this specific adventure, there is always the possibility to talk your way
        out of a bad situation. Keep that in mind.<br><br>

        <font size="4">CHARACTERS</font><br>
        Here we propose 5 characters that might cover all the roles in a typical fantasy TTRPG party, but they have a
        certain twist to it. The point that we want to make is that with this system you can make characters that would
        not be feasible with class-level-based systems. Or they could be made but not early on. Here you have extreme
        customization to make the weirdest things that come to mind, while you could still follow the traditional path
        if you want.<br><br>
