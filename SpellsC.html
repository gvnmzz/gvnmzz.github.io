Call Lightning<br>
Evocation [Electricity]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One or more 30-ft.-long vertical lines of lightning<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Reflex half<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell's range (measured from your position at the time). Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is affected.<br>
You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed. However, each round after the first you may use an action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level (maximum 10 bolts).<br>
If you are outdoors and in a stormy area&#151;a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size)&#151;each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage instead of 3d6.<br>
This spell functions indoors or underground but not underwater.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Range:</B> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft. per caster level)<br>
Each bolt deals 5d6 points of electricity damage (or 5d10 if created outdoors in a stormy area), and you may call a maximum of 15 bolts.<br>
<br>
Calm Animals<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Animals within 30 ft. of each other<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and harmless. Only ordinary animals (those with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2) can be affected by this spell. All the subjects must be of the same kind, and no two may be more than 30 feet apart. The maximum number of Hit Dice of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + caster level. A dire animal or an animal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; other animals are not.<br>
The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are not helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.<br>
<br>
Calm Emotions<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Area:</B> Creatures in a 20-ft.-radius spread<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration, up to 1 round per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, but <I>calm emotions </I>can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.<br>
This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as <I>bless, good hope, </I>and <I>rage, </I>as well as negating a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the <I>confused </I>condition from all targets<I>. </I>While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect. When the <I>calm emotions </I>spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.<br>
<br>
Cat's Grace<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
The transmuted creature becomes more graceful, agile, and coordinated. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, adding the usual benefits to AC, Reflex saves, and other uses of the Dexterity modifier.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One creature per caster level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>

<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One living creature with 5 or fewer HD<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1d4 rounds or 1 round; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will partial<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
The affected creature becomes frightened. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, it is shaken for 1 round. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are immune to this effect.<br>
<I>Cause fear </I>counters and dispels <I>remove fear</I>.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 2<br>

Creatures of less than 6 HD to become frightened.<br>
<br>

<br>
Chain Lightning<br>
Evocation [Electricity]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One primary target, plus one secondary target per caster level (each of which must be within 30 ft. of the primary target)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Reflex half<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike <I>lightning bolt</I>, <I>chain lightning </I>strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets.<br>
The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (rounded down).<br>
Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.<br>
<br>
Changestaff<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Your touched staff<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treantlike creature, about 24 feet tall. When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.<br>
<I>Focus: </I>The quarterstaff, which must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew, then cured, shaped, carved, and polished (a process requiring twenty-eight days).<br>
You cannot adventure or engage in other strenuous activity during the shaping and carving of the staff.<br>
<br>
Chaos Hammer<br>
Evocation [Chaotic]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Area:</B> 20-ft.-radius burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous (1d6 rounds); see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will partial; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You unleash chaotic power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a multicolored explosion of leaping, ricocheting energy. Only lawful and neutral (not chaotic) creatures are harmed by the spell.<br>
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to lawful creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to lawful outsiders) and slows them for 1d6 rounds.<br>
A slowed creature can take only a single action or move action on each of its turns, plus free actions as normal. In addition, it takes a &#150;2 penalty to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and Reflex saves. A successful Will save reduces the damage by half and negates the slow effect.<br>
The spell deals only half damage against creatures who are neither lawful nor chaotic, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.<br>
<br>
Charm<br>
Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One humanoid creature or animal<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This charm makes a humanoid or animal creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.<br>
The spell does not enable you to control the <I>charmed </I> creature as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.  Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the <I>charmed </I>creature breaks the spell. You must speak the creature's language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Target:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> One day per caster level<br>
The effect is not restricted by creature type or size.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
<B>Duration:</B> One day per caster level<br>
It affects a number of creatures whose combined HD do not exceed twice your caster level, or at least one creature regardless of HD. If there are more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one at a time until you choose a creature with too many HD.<br>

<br>
Chill Metal<br>
Transmutation [Cold]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, DF<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target: </B>Metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or 25 lb. of metal per caster level, none of which can be more than 30 ft. away from any of the rest<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 7 rounds<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (object)<br>
<I>Chill metal </I>makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.<br>
A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.<br>
On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.<br>

Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. Underwater, <I>chill metal </I>deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant.<br>
<I>Chill metal </I>counters and dispels <I>heat metal</I>.<br>

Chill Touch<br>
Necromancy<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Creature or creatures touched (up to one per caster level)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Fortitude partial or Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals 1d6 points of damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of Strength damage unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.<br>
An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make a successful Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds +1 round per caster level.<br>
<br>
Circle of Death<br>
Necromancy [Death]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Area:</B> Several living creatures within a 40-ft.-radius burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Fortitude negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A <I>circle of death </I>snuffs out the life force of living creatures, killing them instantly.<br>
The spell slays 1d4 HD worth of living creatures per caster level (maximum 20d4). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected first. No creature of 9 or more HD can be affected, and Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>The powder of a crushed black pearl with a minimum value of 500 gp.<br>
<br>
Clairaudience/Clairvoyance<br>
Divination (Scrying)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Effect: </B>Magical sensor<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
<I>Clairaudience/clairvoyance </I>creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You don't need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known&#151;a place familiar to you or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn't move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10- foot radius around the center of the spell's effect. <I>Clairaudience/clairvoyance </I>functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.<br>
<br>
Cloak of Chaos<br>
Abjuration [Chaotic]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> 20 ft.<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One creature per caster level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> See text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become <I>confused. </I>This abjuration has four effects.<br>
First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike <I>protection from law</I>, the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures.<br>
Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against lawful spells.<br>
Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as <I>protection from law </I>does.<br>
Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is <I>confused </I>for 1 round (Will save negates, as with the <I>confusion </I>spell, but against the save DC of <I>cloak of chaos</I>).<br>
<I>Focus: </I>A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic, such as a scrap of parchment from a chaotic text. The reliquary costs at least 500 gp.<br>
<br>
Clone<br>
Necromancy<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> 0 ft.<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One clone<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to return). The original's physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.<br>
To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.<br>
When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including the loss of one level or 2 points of Constitution (if the original was a 1st-level character). If this Constitution adjustment would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails. If the original creature has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the clone would otherwise be, the clone is one level below the level at which the original died.<br>
The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment.<br>
A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not preserved.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>The piece of flesh and various laboratory supplies (cost 1,000 gp).<br>
<I>Focus: </I>Special laboratory equipment (cost 500 gp).<br>
<br>
Cloudkill<br>
Conjuration (Creation)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Fortitude partial; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a <I>fog cloud, </I>except that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).<br>
A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage). Holding one's breath doesn't help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell.<br>
Unlike a <I>fog cloud</I>, the <I>cloudkill </I>moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.<br>
Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.<br>
Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.<br>
<br>

<B>Level:</B> 1<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly knocking them unconscious.<br>
Each creature within the cone is affected according to its Hit Dice.<br>
<I>2 HD or less: </I>The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.)<br>
<I>3 or 4 HD: </I>The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round.<br>
<I>5 or more HD: </I>The creature is stunned for 1 round.<br>
Sightless creatures are not affected by <I>color spray</I>.<br>

You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.<br>
<I>Approach: </I>On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.<br>
<I>Drop: </I>On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.<br>
<I>Fall: </I>On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.<br>
<I>Flee: </I>On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.<br>
<I>Halt: </I>The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.<br>
If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.<br>

This spell allows you some degree of control over one or more plant creatures. Affected plant creatures can understand you, and they perceive your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat their attitude as friendly). They will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can try to give a subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) A commanded plant never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.<br>
You can affect a number of plant creatures whose combined level or HD do not exceed twice your caster level.<br>

<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This spell allows you some degree of control over an undead creature. Assuming the subject is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat its attitude as friendly). It will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.<br>
A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &#147;come here,&#148; &#147;go there,&#148; &#147;fight,&#148; &#147;stand still,&#148; and so on. Nonintelligent undead won't resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.<br>
Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks the spell.<br>
Your commands are not telepathic. The undead creature must be able to hear you.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
You contact your deity&#151;or agents thereof &#151;and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular deity contacts a philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. &#147;Unclear&#148; is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.<br>
The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. The entities contacted structure their answers to further their own purposes. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell ends.<br>

You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory. You instantly gain knowledge of as many as three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the natural setting.<br>
In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings&#151;caves, caverns, and the like&#151;the radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.<br>

You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages. In either case, you must touch the creature or the writing. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.<br>
Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as the <I>secret page </I>and <I>illusory script </I>spells). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.<br>

This spell blesses an area with positive energy. Each Charisma check made to turn undead within this area gains a +3 sacred bonus. Every undead creature entering a <I>consecrated </I>area suffers minor disruption, giving it a &#150;1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a <I>consecrated </I>area.<br>
If the <I>consecrated </I>area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 sacred bonus on turning checks, &#150;2 penalties for undead in the area). You cannot consecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than your own patron.<br>
If the area does contain an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pantheon, or higher power other than your patron, the <I>consecrate </I>spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above.<br>

Contact Other Plane<br>
Divination<br>

<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration<br>
You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. (See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt.) The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. (All questions are answered with &#147;yes,&#148; &#147;no,&#148; &#147;maybe,&#148; &#147;never,&#148; &#147;irrelevant,&#148; or some other one-word answer.)<br>
You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (an action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. For every two caster levels, you may ask one question.<br>
Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease to Intelligence and Charisma, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the entity answering correctly, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes.<br>
Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.)<br>
On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces.<br>

You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting <I>contingency</I>. The <I>contingency </I>spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead.<br>
The spell to be brought into effect by the <I>contingency </I>must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).<br>
The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the <I>contingency </I>immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being &#147;cast&#148; instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (<I>contingency </I>and the companion magic) may fail when called on. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.<br>
You can use only one <I>contingency </I>spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.<br>

Depending on the version you choose, the <I>control water </I>spell raises or lowers water.<br>
<I>Lower Water: </I>This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a <I>slow </I>spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures.<br>
<I>Raise Water: </I>This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the <I>lower water </I>version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.<br>
With either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.<br>

You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather&#151;where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use an action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.<br>

You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an &#147;eye&#148; of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area less than your full limit.<br>
<I>Wind Direction: </I>You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell's area.<br>
&#149; A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions.<br>
&#149; An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before impinging on the eye in the center.<br>
&#149; A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion.<br>
&#149; A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.<br>
<I>Wind Strength: </I>For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level. Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect of being in the windy area.<br>
Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.<br>
A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.<br>
A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships.<br>
Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder.<br>
A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large trees.<br>

You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead to be created into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse.

<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
When you utter the spell of <I>creeping doom, </I>you call forth a mass of centipede swarms (one per two caster levels, to a maximum of ten swarms at 20th level), which need not appear adjacent to one another.<br>
You may summon the centipede swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. The swarms remain stationary, attacking any creatures in their area, unless you command the creeping doom to move (an action). As an action, you can command any number of the swarms to move toward any prey within 100 feet of you. You cannot command any swarm to move more than 100 feet away from you, and if you move more than 100 feet from any swarm, that swarm remains stationary, attacking any creatures in its area (but it can be commanded again if you move within 100 feet).<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will half (harmless); see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless); see text<br>
When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).<br>
Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.<br>
<B>At Higher Levels: </B>2-4<br>
It cures 1d8 more points of damage per spell level above 1st (maximum 4d8 at spell level 4).<br>
<B>At Higher Levels: </B>5-8<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature per caster level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
