<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
Any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the warded creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area or effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act.<br>

Scintillating Pattern<br>
Illusion (Pattern) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Colorful lights in a 20-ft.-radius spread<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration + 2 rounds<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A twisting pattern of discordant, coruscating colors weaves through the air, affecting creatures within it. The spell affects a total number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. The spell affects each subject according to its Hit Dice.<br>
<I>6 or less: </I>Unconscious for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then <I>confused </I>for 1d4 rounds. (Treat an unconscious result as stunned for nonliving creatures.)<br>
<I>7 to 12: </I>Stunned for 1d4 rounds, then <I>confused </I>for 1d4 rounds. <br>
<I>13 or more: Confused </I>for 1d4 rounds. <br>
Sightless creatures are not affected by <I>scintillating pattern</I>.<br>

Scorching Ray<br>
Evocation [Fire]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One or more rays<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You blast your enemies with fiery rays. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four caster levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage.<br>
The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all bolts must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.<br>
<br>
Screen<br>
Illusion (Glamer)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Area:</B> 30-ft. cube per caster level (S)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 24 hours<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None or Will disbelief (if interacted with); see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from scrying and direct observation. When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.<br>
Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. <br>
Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.<br>

<B>Saving Throw:</B> Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You can see and hear some creature, which may be at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the scrying attempt simply fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save.<br>

If the save fails, you can see (but not hear) the subject and the subject's immediate surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet.<br>
As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects. In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: <I>detect chaos</I>, <I>detect evil</I>, <I>detect good</I>, <I>detect law</I>, <I>detect magic</I>, and <I>message</I>.<br>
If the save succeeds, you can't attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24 hours.<br>

<B>Targets:</B> One creature or object per caster level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (object)<br>
You change the sounds that creatures or objects make. You can create sounds where none exist, deaden sounds, or transform sounds into other sounds. All affected creatures or objects must be transmuted in the same way. Once the transmutation is made, you cannot change it.<br>
You can change the qualities of sounds but cannot create words with which you are unfamiliar yourself.<br>
A spellcaster whose voice is changed dramatically is unable to cast spells with verbal components.<br>

<B>Effect:</B> Ray<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You project a blast of light from your open palm. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. A creature struck by this ray of light takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). An undead creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), and an undead creature particularly vulnerable to bright light takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). A construct or inanimate object takes only 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6).<br>
<br>
Secret Chest<br>
Conjuration (Summoning)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> See text<br>
<B>Target:</B> One chest and up to 1 cu. ft. of goods/caster level<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Sixty days or until discharged<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as sixty days and can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the chest's actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a action), and it appears next to you.<br>
The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time&#151;even a <I>wish </I>spell does not allow more. The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.<br>
To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a <I>wish </I>spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.<br>
Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive.<br>

S<I>ecret page </I>alters the contents of a page so that they appear to be something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show even another spell. <I>Explosive runes </I>or <I>sepia snake sigil </I>can be cast upon the <I>secret page.<br>
</I>A <I>comprehend languages </I>spell alone cannot reveal a <I>secret page</I>'s contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual page, and return it to its <I>secret page </I>form at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. A <I>detect magic </I>spell reveals dim magic on the page in question but does not reveal its true contents. T<I>rue seeing </I>reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with <I>comprehend languages. </I>A <I>secret page </I>spell can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an <I>erase </I>spell.<br>

Secure Shelter<br>
Conjuration (Creation)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F; see text<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> 20-ft.-square structure<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 2 hours per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.<br>
The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise&#151;it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).<br>
The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being <I>arcane locked </I>and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an <I>alarm </I>spell. Finally, an <I>unseen servant </I>is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter.<br>
The <I>secure shelter </I>contains rude furnishings &#151;eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.<br>

<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 min. per caster level (D)<br>
You can see any objects or beings that are invisible within your range of vision, as well as any that are ethereal, as if they were normally visible. Such creatures are visible to you as translucent shapes, allowing you easily to discern the difference between visible, invisible, and ethereal creatures.<br>
The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures who are simply hiding, concealed, or otherwise hard to see.<br>
<I>See invisibility </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell.<br>

Sending<br>
Evocation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> See text<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of twenty-five words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the <I>sending, </I>though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence score. Even if the <I>sending </I>is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.<br>
If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the <I>sending </I>does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)<br>
<br>
Sepia Snake Sigil<br>
Conjuration (Creation) [Force]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> One touched book or written work<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent or until discharged; until released or 1d4 days + one day per caster level; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Reflex negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
When you cast <I>sepia snake sigil, </I>a small symbol appears in the text of one written work such as a book, scroll, or map. The text containing the symbol must be at least twenty-five words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the <I>sepia snake </I>springs into being and strikes the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader.<br>
Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds, the <I>sepia snake </I>dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + one day per caster level have elapsed.<br>
While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.<br>
The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and <I>detect magic </I>reveals only that the entire text is magical.<br>
A <I>dispel magic </I>can remove the sigil. An <I>erase </I>spell destroys the entire page of text.<br>
<I>Sepia snake sigil </I>can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as <I>secret page.<br>
Material Component: </I>500 gp worth of powdered amber, a scale from any snake, and a pinch of mushroom spores.<br>

Sequester<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Level:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> One willing creature or object (up to a 2-ft. cube per caster level) touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> One day per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None or Will negates (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No or Yes (object)<br>
When cast, this spell not only prevents divination spells from working to detect or locate the creature or object affected by <I>sequester, </I>it also renders the affected creature or object invisible to any form of sight or seeing (as the <I>invisibility </I>spell). The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by <I>sequester </I>become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell wears off or is dispelled.<br>
<I>Note: </I>The Will save prevents an attended or magical object from being <I>sequestered. </I>There is no save to see the <I>sequestered </I>creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.<br>

Shadow Conjuration<br>
Illusion (Shadow)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> See text<br>
<B>Effect:</B> See text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> See text<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will disbelief (if interacted with); varies; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes; see text<br>
You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. <I>Shadow conjuration </I>can mimic any conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.<br>
<I>Shadow conjurations </I>are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the <I>shadow conjurations </I>to be real are affected by them at full strength.<br>
Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.<br>
Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to <I>shadow conjuration</I>'s level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level. In addition, any effect created by <I>shadow conjuration </I>allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them.<br>
Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.<br>
A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are one-fifth as large.<br>
A creature that succeeds on its save sees the <I>shadow conjurations </I>as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms.<br>
Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B>  7<br>
This spell can duplicate any conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 6th level or lower. The illusory conjurations created deal three-fifths (60%) damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 60% likely to work against nonbelievers.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 9<br>
This spell mimics conjuration spells of 8th level or lower. The illusory conjurations created deal four-fifths (80%) damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 80% likely to work against nonbelievers.<br>
<br>
Shadow Evocation<br>
Illusion (Shadow)<br>
<B>Level:</B> Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> See text<br>
<B>Effect:</B> See text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> See text<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will disbelief (if interacted with)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of evocation spell of 4th level or lower. (For a spell with more than one level, use the best one applicable to you.)<br>
Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a <I>shadow evocation, </I>a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) damage. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or spell resistance) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to <I>shadow evocation'</I>s level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.<br>
Nondamaging effects have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they have no effect.<br>
Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 8<br>
This spell enables you to create partially real, illusory versions evocation spells of 7th level or lower. If recognized as a <I>greater shadow evocation</I>, a damaging spell deals only three-fifths (60%) damage.<br>
<br>
Shadow Walk<br>
Illusion (Shadow)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to one touched creature/ level<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
To use the <I>shadow walk </I>spell, you must be in an area of shadowy illumination. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.<br>
In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.<br>
Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10x100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10x1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).<br>
<I>Shadow walk </I>can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.<br>
Any creatures touched by you when <I>shadow walk </I>is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.<br>
They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.<br>

<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Three or more shambling mounds, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; see text<br>

<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
The <I>shambler </I>spell creates 1d4+2 shambling mounds with 11 HD each. The creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for seven days unless you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is seven months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell's range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared. <br>
The shamblers have resistance to fire as normal shambling mounds do only if the terrain is rainy, marshy, or damp.<br>

Evocation [Sonic]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Area or Target:</B> 5-ft.-radius spread; or one solid object or one crystalline creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (object); Will negates (object) or Fortitude half; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (object)<br>
<I>Shatter </I>creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature.<br>
Used as an area attack, <I>shatter </I>destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.<br>
Alternatively, you can target <I>shatter </I>against a single solid object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), <I>shatter </I>deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.<br>

Shield<br>
Abjuration [Force]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<I>Shield </I>creates an invisible, tower shield-sized mobile disk of force that hovers in front of you. It negates <I>magic missile </I>attacks directed at you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect. Unlike with a normal tower shield, you can't use the <I>shield </I>spell for cover.<br>
<br>

Shield of Faith<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
This spell creates a shimmering, magical field around the touched creature that averts attacks. The spell grants the subject a +2 deflection bonus to AC, with an additional +1 to the bonus for every six casters levels you have (maximum +5 deflection bonus at caster level 18).<br>
<br>
Shield of Law<br>
Abjuration [Lawful]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> 20 ft.<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One creature per caster level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> See text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and <I>slowing </I>chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.<br>
First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike <I>protection from chaos</I>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures.<br>
Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.<br>
Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as <I>protection from chaos </I>does.<br>
Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is <I>slowed </I>(Will save negates, as the <I>slow </I>spell, but against <I>shield of law</I>'s save DC).<br>
<I>Focus: </I>A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic, such as a scrap of parchment from a lawful text. The reliquary costs at least 500 gp.<br>

<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that some of its wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including that dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as <I>charm </I>effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject.<br>
If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.<br>
<I>Focus: </I>A pair of platinum rings (worth at least 50 gp each) worn by both you and the warded creature.<br>

<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> One touched nonmagical oak club or quarterstaff<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (object)<br>
Your own nonmagical club or quarterstaff becomes a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. (A quarterstaff gains this enhancement for both ends of the weapon.) It deals damage as if it were two size categories larger (a Small club or quarterstaff so transmuted deals 1d8 points of damage, a Medium 2d6, and a Large 3d6), +1 for its enhancement bonus. These effects only occur when the weapon is wielded by you. If you do not wield it, the weapon behaves as if unaffected by this spell.<br>
<br>
Shocking Grasp<br>
Evocation [Electricity]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>

<B>Target:</B> Creature or object touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d6). When delivering the jolt, you gain a +3 bonus on attack rolls if the opponent is wearing metal armor (or made out of metal, carrying a lot of metal, or the like).<br>
<br>

Evocation [Sonic]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>

<B>Range:</B> 30 ft.<br>
<B>Area:</B> Cone-shaped burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Fortitude partial or Reflex negates (object); see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (object)<br>
You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). An affected creature is allowed a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half, and a creature holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with a successful Reflex save.<br>
A <I>shout </I>spell cannot penetrate a <I>silence </I>spell.<br>
<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Range:</B> 60 ft.<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Fortitude partial or Reflex negates (object); see text<br>
The cone deals 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level, maximum 20d6, against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. A creature in the area of the cone can negate the stunning and halve both the damage and the duration of the deafness with a successful Fortitude save. A creature holding vulnerable objects can attempt a Reflex save to negate the damage to those objects.<br>
<br>
Shrink Item<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> One touched object of up to 2 cu. ft. per caster level<br>
<B>Duration:</B> One day per caster level; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (object)<br>
You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object's size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a <I>shrink item </I>spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.<br>
<I>Shrink item </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.<br>

Silence<br>
Illusion (Glamer)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Area:</B> 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object, or point in space<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates; see text or none (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes; see text or no (object)<br>
Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not. This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks.<br>

Silent Image<br>
Illusion (Figment)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>

<B>Effect:</B> Visual figment that cannot extend beyond four 10-ft. cubes + one 10-ft. cube per caster level (S)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will disbelief (if interacted with)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by you. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration +2 rounds<br>
The spell includes some minor sounds but not understandable speech.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration + 3 rounds<br>
The spell effect includes sound, smell, and thermal illusions. While concentrating, you can move the image within the range. <br>
The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless you cause the illusion to react appropriately.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components, and the figment follows a script determined by you. The figment follows that script without your having to concentrate on it. The illusion can include intelligible speech if you wish. <br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Figment that cannot extend beyond a 20-ft. cube + one 10-ft. cube per caster level (S)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent (D)<br>
The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, and the spell is permanent. By concentrating, you can move the image within the limits of the range, but it is static while you are not concentrating.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>A bit of fleece plus powdered jade worth 100 gp.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Visual figment that cannot extend beyond a 20-ft. cube + one 10-ft. cube per caster level (S)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent until triggered, then 1 round per caster level<br>
The figment activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech.<br>
You set the triggering condition (which may be a special word) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. (See <I>magic mouth </I>for more details about such triggers.)<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>A bit of fleece and jade dust worth 25 gp.<br>

Simulacrum<br>
Illusion (Shadow)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 12 hours<br>
<B>Range:</B> 0 ft.<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One duplicate creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
<I>Simulacrum </I>creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The duplicate creature is partially real and formed from ice or snow. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has only one-half of the real creature's levels or Hit Dice (and the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or HD). You can't create a simulacrum of a creature whose Hit Dice or levels exceed twice your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A creature familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful Spot check (opposed by the caster's Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check.<br>
At all times the simulacrum remains under your absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly into nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 24 hours, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped magical laboratory can repair damage to a simulacrum.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>The spell is cast over the rough snow or ice form, and some piece of the creature to be duplicated (hair, nail, or the like) must be placed inside the snow or ice. Additionally, the spell requires powdered ruby worth 100 gp per HD of the simulacrum to be created.<br>
<I>Material component: </I>500 gp in diamond dust per HD of the simulacrum to be created (minimum 5,000 gp).<br>

<B>Target:</B> Living creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Fortitude partial<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You can slay any one living creature. You must succeed on a melee touch attack to touch the subject, and it can avoid death with a successful Fortitude save. If it succeeds, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level.<br>
<br>
Sleep<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>

<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Area:</B> One or more living creatures within a 10-ft.-radius burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A <I>sleep </I>spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.<br>
Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.<br>
Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a action (an application of the aid another action).<br>
<I>Sleep </I>does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
It affects 10 HD of creatures.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
Driving sleet blocks all sight (even darkvision) within it and causes the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details).<br>
The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.<br>

Slow<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F</br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One creature per caster level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. A <I>slowed </I>creature can take only a single move action or action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a &#150;1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A <I>slowed </I>creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.<br>
Multiple <I>slow </I>effects don't stack. <I>Slow </I>counters and dispels <I>haste</I>.<br>

Snare<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 3 rounds<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Touched nonmagical circle of vine, rope, or thong with a 2 ft. diameter + 2 ft. per caster level<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Until triggered or broken<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast <I>snare </I>upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (Search DC 23 for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.<br>
If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.<br>
The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.<br>
<br>
Soften Earth and Stone<br>
Transmutation [Earth]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Area:</B> 10-ft. square per caster level; see text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the spell's area is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped. You affect a 10-footsquare area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not affected.<br>
A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can't run or charge.<br>
Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface.<br>
Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.<br>
While <I>soften earth and stone </I>does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls.<br>
A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other rather than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50% chance to attack the nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each creature's behavior every round at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act normally for that round.<br>
Creatures forced by a <I>song of discord </I>to attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have fallen unconscious.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Permanent<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You draw the soul from a newly dead body and imprison it in a black sapphire gem. The subject must have been dead no more than 1 round per caster level. The soul, once trapped in the gem, cannot be returned through <I>clone, raise dead, reincarnation, resurrection, true resurrection, </I>or even a <I>miracle </I>or a <I>wish. </I>Only by destroying the gem or dispelling the spell on the gem can one free the soul (which is then still dead).<br>
<I>Focus: </I>A black sapphire of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature whose soul is to be bound. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the binding is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or Hit Dice as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice.)<br>

You blast an area with a tremendous cacophony. Every creature in the area takes 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1 round. <br>
Creatures that cannot hear are not stunned but are still damaged.<br>

You can comprehend and communicate with animals. You are able to ask questions of and receive answers from animals, although the spell doesn't make them any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you.<br>

Speak with Dead<br>
Necromancy [Language-Dependent]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> 10 ft.<br>
<B>Target:</B> One dead creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You grant the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that you put to it. You may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the creature's alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive.<br>
If the corpse has been subject to <I>speak with dead </I>within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all. <br>
This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information.<br>
Indeed, it can't even remember being questioned.<br>
This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
You can comprehend and communicate with plants, including both normal plants and plant creatures. You are able to ask questions of and receive answers from plants. A regular plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity.<br>
The spell doesn't make plant creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning plant creatures are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones may make inane comments. If a plant creature is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you.<br>

Spectral Hand<br>
Necromancy<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One spectral hand<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
A ghostly, glowing hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves as you desire, allowing you to deliver low-level, touch range spells at a distance. On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the spell ends (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed. (The hit points can be healed as normal.) For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the <I>spectral hand</I>. The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if the hand goes beyond the spell range, goes out of your sight, the hand returns to you and hovers.<br>
The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has improved evasion (half damage on a failed Reflex save and no damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an AC of at least 22. Your Intelligence modifier applies to the hand's AC as if it were the hand's Dexterity modifier. The hand has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you lost in creating it.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 10 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every four caster levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the specified spell or spells. Naturally, that immunity doesn't protect a creature from spells for which spell resistance doesn't apply. <I>Spell immunity </I>protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks.<br>
Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect. <br>
A creature can have only one <I>spell immunity </I>or <I>greater spell immunity </I>spell in effect on it at a time.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 8<br>
The immunity applies to spells of 8th level or lower.<br>

You store one spell that you can normally cast in a wooden quarterstaff. Only one such spell can be stored in a staff at a given time, and you cannot have more than one <I>spellstaff </I>at any given time. You can cast a spell stored within a staff just as though it were among those you had prepared, but it does not count against your normal allotment for a given day.

<B>Duration:</B> Until expended or 10 min. per caster level<br>
Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. <I>Spell turning </I>also fails to stop touch range spells. <I><br>
</I>From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is rolled secretly.<br>
When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned. The subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be affected.<br>
If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by <I>spell turning </I>effects in operation, a resonating field is created.<br>
Roll randomly to determine the result.<br>

<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). A <I>spider climbing </I>creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Reflex partial<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell's area becomes very hard and sharply pointed without changing its appearance.<br>
In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Typically, <I>spike growth </I>can be cast in any outdoor setting except open water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.<br>
Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its land speed by one-half. This speed penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a <I>cure </I>spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.<br>
<I>Spike growth </I>can't be disabled with the Disable Device skill.<br>
<I>Note: </I>Magic traps such as <I>spike growth </I>are hard to detect. The DC is 25 + spell level.<br>

Rocky ground, stone floors, and similar surfaces shape themselves into long, sharp points that blend into the background.<br>
<I>Spike stones </I>impede progress through an area and deal damage. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area moves at half speed.<br>
In addition, each creature moving through the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.<br>
Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs. A failed save causes the creature's speed to be reduced to half normal for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a <I>cure </I>spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.<br>

Spiritual Weapon<br>
Evocation [Force]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Effect: </B>Magic weapon of force<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A weapon made of pure force springs into existence and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.<br>
Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the <I>spiritual weapon </I>is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.<br>
A <I>spiritual weapon </I>cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <I>dispel magic</I>, <I>disintegrate</I>, a <I>sphere of annihilation</I>, or a <I>rod of cancellation </I>affects it. A <I>spiritual weapon</I>'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).<br>
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <I>spiritual weapon </I>strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.<br>

A <I>statue </I>spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried. In statue form, the subject gains hardness 8. The subject retains its own hit points.<br>
The subject can see, hear, and smell normally, but it does not need to eat or breathe. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body. Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off one of the statue's arms constitutes serious damage.<br>
The subject of a <I>statue </I>spell can return to its normal state, act, and then return instantly to the statue state (a free action) if it so desires, as long as the spell duration is in effect.<br>

When you need to keep track of comrades who may get separated, <I>status </I>allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general condition. You are aware of direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious, dying, nauseated, panicked, stunned, poisoned, diseased, <I>confused, </I>or the like. Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it.<br>

<I>Stinking cloud </I>creates a bank of fog like that created by <I>fog cloud</I>, except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the cloud become nauseated. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each nauseated character.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn.<br>
<I>Stinking cloud </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell. A permanent <I>stinking cloud </I>dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.<br>

The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject gains damage reduction 10/adamantine. (It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction.) Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.<br>

You gain the ability to speak with stones, which relate to you who or what has touched them as well as revealing what is covered or concealed behind or under them.

This spell restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to survive the process. Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored.<br>
The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available. (For example, this spell would turn a stone golem into a flesh golem, but an ordinary statue would become a corpse.) You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Concentration (maximum 10 rounds) (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> See text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This spell creates an enormous black storm cloud. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder appear within the storm. Each creature beneath the cloud must succeed on a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4x10 minutes.<br>
If you do not maintain concentration on the spell after casting it, the spell ends.  If you continue to concentrate, the spell generates additional effects in each following round, as noted below. Each effect occurs during your turn.<br>
<I>2nd Round: </I>Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage (no save).<br>
<I>3rd Round: </I>You call six bolts of lightning down from the cloud. You decide where the bolts strike. No two bolts may be directed at the same target. Each bolt deals 10d6 points of electricity damage. A creature struck can attempt a Reflex save for half damage.<br>
<I>4th Round: </I>Hailstones rain down in the area, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save).<br>
<I>5th through 10th Rounds: </I>Violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Speed is reduced by three-quarters.<br>
Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the <I>storm of vengeance</I>'s save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast.<br>

You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The <I>suggestion </I>must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. <br>
The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.<br>

This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.<br>
The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying Summon Monster table. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.<br>
A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.<br>

You can summon one creature from the the list at the level of the spell or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the list at one level lower than the level of the spell, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.<br>

<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One swarm of bats, rats, or spiders<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration + 2 rounds<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You summon a swarm of bats, rats, or spiders (your choice), which attacks all other creatures within its area. (You may summon the swarm so that it shares the area of other creatures.) If no living creatures are within its area, the swarm attacks or pursues the nearest creature as best it can. The caster has no control over its target or direction of travel.<br>

Sunbeam<br>
Evocation [Light]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 7<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level or until all beams are exhausted<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Reflex negates and Reflex half; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
For the duration of this spell, you can use a action to evoke a dazzling beam of intense light each round. You can call forth one beam per three caster levels (maximum six beams at 18th level). The spell ends when its duration runs out or your allotment of beams is exhausted.<br>
Each creature in the beam is blinded and takes 4d6 points of damage. Any creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural take double damage. A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half.<br>
An undead creature caught within the beam takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half damage if a Reflex save is successful. In addition, the beam results in the destruction of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light if it fails its save.<br>
The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead creatures.<br>

Symbol<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> 0 ft.; see text<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One symbol<br>
<B>Duration:</B> See text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Varies negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. Any creature that enters the area while the <I>symbol </I>is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <I>symbol </I>only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <I>symbol </I>is still active, it must save again.<br>
Until it is triggered, the <I>symbol </I>is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <I>symbol </I>must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <I>symbol </I>ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case it works normally.<br>
As a default, a <I>symbol </I>is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <I>symbol</I>'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.<br>
In this case, &#147;reading&#148; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <I>symbol </I>to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a <I>symbol </I>offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered <I>symbol</I> remains untriggered if an item bearing the <I>symbol </I>is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <I>symbol </I>cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.<br>
You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <I>symbol </I>can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as Hit Dice and hit points don't qualify. <br>
When scribing a <I>symbol</I>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.<br>
You also can attune any number of creatures to the <I>symbol, </I>but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a <I>symbol </I>cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <I>symbol </I>, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.<br>
<I>Read magic </I>allows you to identify a <I>symbol </I>with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the <I>symbol </I>is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.<br>
A <I>symbol </I>can be removed by a successful <I>dispel magic </I>targeted solely on the rune. An <I>erase </I>spell has no effect on a <I>symbol. </I>Destruction of the surface where a <I>symbol </I>is inscribed destroys the <I>symbol </I>but also triggers it.<br>
<I>Symbol </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell. A permanent <I>symbol </I>that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.<br>
The Symbol can have the following effects:<br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    Sleep<br>
    Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
    <B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
    All creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the <I>symbol of sleep </I> fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6x10 minutes. Unlike with the <I>sleep </I>spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.<br>
    <br>
    Pain<br>
    Necromancy [Evil]<br>
    <B>Saving Throw: </B>Fortitude negates<br>
    Each creature within the radius of a <I>symbol of pain </I>suffers wracking pains that impose disadvantage on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.<br>
    Once triggered, <I>symbol of pain </I>simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.<br>
</p>
<I>Note: </I>Magic traps such as <I>symbol </I>are hard to detect and disable. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp each.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 6<br>

    Necromancy [Fear, Mind-Affecting]<br>
    <B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
    All creatures within 60 feet of the <I>symbol of fear </I>instead become panicked for 1 round per caster level.<br>
    <br>
    Persuasion<br>
    Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
    <B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
    All creatures within the radius of a <I>symbol of persuasion </I> become <I>charmed </I>by the caster (as the <I>charm monster </I>spell) for 1 hour per caster level.<br>
    Once triggered, a <I>symbol of persuasion </I>remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.<br>
</p>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 7<br>
The Symbol can have the following effects:<br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">

    <br>
    Weakness<br>
    Necromancy<br>
    <B>Saving Throw: </B>Fortitude negates<br>
    Every creature within 60 feet of a <I>symbol of weakness </I> suffers crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of Strength damage.<br>
    Once triggered, a <I>symbol of weakness </I> remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.<br>
</p>
<I>Material Component: </I>Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 8<br>
The Symbol can have the following effects:<br>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    Death<br>
    Necromancy [Death]<br>
    <B>Saving Throw: </B>Fortitude negates<br>
    When triggered, a <I>symbol of death </I>slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The <I>symbol of death </I>affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <I>symbol of death </I>becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first.<br>
    <br>
    Insanity<br>
    Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
    <B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
    All creatures within the radius of the <I>symbol of insanity </I>instead become permanently insane (as the <I>insanity </I>spell).<br>
    Once triggered, a <I>symbol of insanity </I> remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.<br>
</p>
Sympathetic Vibration<br>
Evocation [Sonic]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> One freestanding structure<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Up to 1 round per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
By attuning yourself to a freestanding structure such you can create a damaging vibration within it. Once it begins, the vibration deals 2d10 points of damage per round to the target structure. (Hardness has no effect on the spell's damage.) You can choose at the time of casting to limit the duration of the spell; otherwise it lasts for 1 round/ level. If the spell is cast upon a target that is not freestanding the surrounding stone dissipates the effect and no damage occurs.<br>
<I>Sympathetic vibration </I>cannot affect creatures (including constructs). Since a structure is an unattended object, it gets no saving throw to resist the effect.<br>
<br>
Sympathy<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One location (up to a 10-ft. cube per caster level) or one object<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 2 hours per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that attract either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The particular kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named.<br>
Creatures of the specified kind or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or to possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6x10 minutes later. If this save fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or object.<br>
<I>Sympathy </I>counters and dispels <I>antipathy</I>.<br>
