You conjure and launch a glowing green bolt of acidic energy from your focus. The bolt flies straight toward a creature within far reach. You must make a ranged spell attack against the target's AC.<br>
On a hit, the bolt deals <b>2d4 acid damage</b>. The corrosive magic continues to burn, dealing <b>2d4 acid damage at the start of the target’s next turn</b>.<br>
When cast using a higher-level spell slot:<br>
— <b>3rd level:</b> Burns for 2 rounds total (initial + 1 round)<br>
— <b>4th level:</b> Burns for 3 rounds total<br>
— <b>5th level or higher:</b> Burns for 4 rounds total (maximum)<br>
The acid effect ends early if it is neutralized or magically removed.<br>

<b>Duration:</b> 11 rounds<br>
<b>Defence:</b> None<br>
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> No<br>
You conjure a dense cloud of acidic mist that spreads rapidly from the point of origin. The fog obscures vision and turns the area into difficult terrain.<br>

Acid Splash <br>
Conjuration (Creation) [Acid]<br>
<B>Level: </B>0<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per two caster levels)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One missile of acid<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You fire a small orb of acid at the target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The orb deals 1d3 points of acid damage.<br>
<br>

Aid<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<b>Level:</b> 2<br>
<b>Components:</b> V, S, F<br>
<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
<b>Range:</b> Reach<br>
<b>Target:</b> One living creature<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 3 minutes<br>
<b>Defence:</b> None<br>
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)<br>
You touch an ally, infusing them with resolve and vitality. The target gains a <b>+1 morale bonus</b> to attack rolls and on defence against fear effects. In addition, the target gains <b>1d8 + skill score</b> temporary hit points (to a maximum of 1d8 + 10).<br>
These temporary hit points last for the duration or until lost.<br>
<br>

Air Walk<br>
Transmutation [Air]<br>
<b>Level:</b> 4<br>
<b>Components:</b> V, S, F<br>
<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
<b>Range:</b> Reach<br>
<b>Target:</b> One creature (Gargantuan or smaller)<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 70 minutes<br>
<b>Defence:</b> None<br>
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)<br>
The target can walk through the air as though it were solid ground. It can ascend or descend at an angle of up to 45 degrees, but does so at half its normal walking speed.<br>
<br>
A strong wind (over 20 mph) affects the target's movement. At the end of each round, the target is pushed 5 feet for every 5 mph of wind speed. In turbulent conditions, the target may lose control or take damage at the referee's discretion.<br>
<br>
If the spell ends while the creature is still aloft, it descends slowly—floating down 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that time, it lands safely. Otherwise, it falls the remaining distance and takes falling damage as normal.<br>
<br>
This spell is cast through your focus, allowing you to direct the effect without physical contact.<br>
<br>
You may also cast this spell on a specially trained mount, allowing it to be ridden through the air. Training a mount for this requires one week of work and a successful Handle Animal check (DC 25).<br>
<br>

Alarm <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per two caster levels.)<br>
<B>Area:</B> 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 2 hours per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
<I>Alarm </I>sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the <I>alarm</I>. You decide at the time of casting whether the <I>alarm </I>will be mental or audible.<br>
<I>Mental Alarm: </I>A mental <I>alarm </I>alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental &#147;ping&#148; that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A <I>silence </I>spell has no effect on a mental <I>alarm</I>.<br>
<I>Audible Alarm: </I>An audible <I>alarm </I>produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.<br>
In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a <I>silence </I>spell cannot hear the ringing.<br>
Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the <I>alarm</I>.<br>
<I>Alarm </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell.<br>
<br>


Align Weapon <br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target: </B>Weapon touched or fifty projectiles (all of which must be in contact with each other at the time of casting)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless, object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless, object)<br>
<I>Align weapon </I>makes a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as you choose. A weapon that is aligned can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures. This spell has no effect on a weapon that already has an alignment.<br>
You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike.<br>
<br>
Analyze Dweomer <br>
Divination<br>
<B>Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per two caster levels)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One object or creature per caster level<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None or Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You discern all spells and magical properties present in a number of creatures or objects. Each round, you may examine a single creature or object that you can see without using an action. In the case of a magic item, you learn its functions, how to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if it uses charges). In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level.<br>
An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other <I>analyze dweomer </I>spells for 24 hours.<br>
<I>Analyze dweomer </I>does not function when used on an artifact.<br>
<I>Focus: </I>A tiny lens of ruby or sapphire set in a small golden loop. The gemstone must be worth at least 1,500 gp.<br>
<br>

Animal Growth <br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to one animal (Gargantuan or smaller) per two caster levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Fortitude negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A number of animals grow to twice their normal size and eight times their normal weight. This alteration changes each animal's size category to the next largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a &#150;2 size penalty to Dexterity. The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage. The animal's space and reach change as appropriate to the new size, but its speed does not change.<br>
The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it&#151; the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.<br>
All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.<br>
Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size.<br>
The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.<br>
Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.<br>
<br>

Animal Messenger <br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per two caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One Tiny animal<br>
<B>Duration:</B> One day per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions.<br>
You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own. You can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.<br>
During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he or she doesn't know, for example).<br>
<br>

Animal Shapes <br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per two caster levels)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to one willing creature per level, all within 30 ft. of each other<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
As <I>polymorph, </I>except you polymorph up to one willing creature per caster level into an animal of your choice; the spell has no effect on unwilling creatures. All creatures must take the same kind of animal form. Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell expires or until you dismiss it for all recipients. In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject alone. The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to the subject's HD or your skill score, whichever is lower, to a maximum of 20 HD.<br>
<br>

Animal Trance <br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting, Sonic]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per two caster levels)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Animals or magical beasts with Intelligence 1 or 2<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
Your swaying motions and music (or singing, or chanting) compel animals and magical beasts to do nothing but watch you. Only a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 can be fascinated by this spell. Roll 2d6 to determine the total number of HD worth of creatures that you fascinate. The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected.<br>
A magical beast, a dire animal, or an animal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; an animal not trained to attack or guard is not.<br>
<br>

Animate Dead <br>
Necromancy [Evil]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One or more corpses touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow your spoken commands.<br>
The undead can follow you, or they can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the place. They remain animated until they are destroyed. (A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again.)<br>
Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead than twice your skill score with a single casting of <I>animate dead</I>. (The <I>desecrate </I>spell doubles this limit)<br>
The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. (You choose which creatures are released.) If you have the Turn/Rebuke skill, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.<br>
<I>Skeletons: </I>A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. <br>
<I>Zombies: </I>A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per Hit Die of the undead into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse you intend to animate. The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless, burned-out shells.<br>
<br>


Animate Objects  <br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One Small object per caster level; see text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. Each such animated object then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate.<br>
An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may animate one Small or smaller object or an equivalent number of larger objects per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.<br>
This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.<br>
<I>Animate objects </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell.<br>
<br>

Animate Plants <br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per two caster levels)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One Large plant per three caster levels or all plants within range; see text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level or 1 hour per caster level; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life. Each animated plant then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate as though it were an animated object of the appropriate size category. You may animate one Large or smaller plant, or an equivalent number of larger plants, per three caster levels. A Huge plant counts as two Large or smaller plants, a Gargantuan plant as four, and a Colossal plant as eight. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.<br>
Use the statistics for animated objects<I>, </I>except that plants smaller than Large usually don't have hardness.<br>
<I>Animate plants </I>cannot affect plant creatures, nor does it affect nonliving vegetable material.<br>
<I>Entangle: </I>Alternatively, you may imbue all plants within range with a degree of mobility, which allows them to entwine around creatures in the area. This usage of the spell duplicates the effect of an <I>entangle </I>spell. Spell resistance does not keep creatures from being entangled. This effect lasts 1 hour per spell point.<br>
<br>


Animate Rope <br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One ropelike object, length up to 50 ft. + 5 ft. per caster level; see text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You can animate a nonliving ropelike object. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter.<br>
Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the rope's diameter by half.<br>
The possible commands are &#147;coil&#148; (form a neat, coiled stack), &#147;coil and knot,&#148; &#147;loop,&#148; &#147;loop and knot,&#148; &#147;tie and knot,&#148; and the opposites of all of the above (&#147;uncoil,&#148; and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell.<br>
The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it&#151;it does not snake outward&#151;so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inch-diameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.<br>
The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.<br>
This spell grants a +2 bonus on any Bondage Mastery checks you make when using the transmuted rope.<br>
The spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.<br>
<br>

Antilife Shell <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Range:</B> 10 ft.<br>
<B>Area:</B> 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that prevents the entrance of most types of living creatures.<br>
The effect hedges out animals, aberrations, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, oozes, plants, and vermin, but not constructs, elementals, outsiders, or undead.<br>
This spell may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.<br>

<br>
Antimagic Field <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> 10 ft.<br>
<B>Area:</B> 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> See text<br>
An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.<br>
An <I>antimagic field </I>suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an <I>antimagic field </I>counts against the suppressed spell's duration.<br>
Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an <I>antimagic field. </I>They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast <I>antimagic field </I>in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + skill score) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations<I> </I>are not affected by an <I>antimagic field </I>because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)<br>
A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. <I>Dispel magic </I>does not remove the field.<br>
Two or more <I>antimagic fields </I>sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as <I>wall of force, prismatic sphere</I>, and <I>prismatic wall, </I>remain unaffected by <I>antimagic field </I>(see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. <br>
Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.<br>
<br>

Antipathy <br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per two caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One location (up to a 10-ft. cube per caster level) or one object<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 2 hours per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will partial<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named.<br>
Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item.<br>
A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's Dexterity score by 4 points.<br>
<I>Antipathy </I>counters and dispels <I>sympathy</I>.<br>

<br>
Antiplant Shell <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> 10 ft.<br>
<B>Area:</B> 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
The <I>antiplant shell </I>spell creates an invisible, mobile barrier that keeps all creatures within the shell protected from attacks by plant creatures or animated plants. As with many abjuration spells, forcing the barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay strains and collapses the field.<br>
<br>

Arcane Eye <br>
Divination (Scrying)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Unlimited<br>
<B>Effect: </B>Magical sensor<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can create the <I>arcane eye </I>at any point you can see, but it can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. An <I>arcane eye </I>travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there.<br>
The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can't enter another plane of existence, even through a <I>gate </I>or similar magical portal.<br>
You must concentrate to use an <I>arcane eye. </I>If you do not concentrate, the eye is inert until you again concentrate.<br>
<br>

Arcane Lock <br>

An <I>arcane lock </I>spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. You can freely pass your own <I>arcane lock </I>without affecting it; otherwise, a door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful <I>dispel magic </I>or <I>knock </I>spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. (A <I>knock </I>spell does not remove an <I>arcane lock; </I>it only suppresses the effect for 10 minutes.)<br>

Arcane Mark <br>
Universal<br>
<B>Level:</B> 0<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> 0 ft.<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One personal rune or mark, all of which must fit within 1 sq. ft.<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An <I>arcane mark </I>spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a <I>detect magic </I>spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.<br>
<I>See invisibility, true seeing</I>, a <I>gem of seeing</I>, or a <I>robe of eyes </I>likewise allows the user to see an invisible <I>arcane mark. </I>A <I>read magic </I>spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an <I>erase </I>spell.<br>
If an <I>arcane mark </I>is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month.<br>
<I>Arcane mark </I>must be cast on an object prior to casting <I>instant summons </I>on the same object (see that spell description for details).<br>

Arcane Sight <br>
Divination<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a <I>detect magic </I>spell, but <I>arcane sight </I>does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.<br>
You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the <I>detect magic </I>spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect.)<br>
If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.<br>
<I>Arcane sight </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 7<br>
You automatically know which spells or magical effects are active upon any individual or object you see. It still doesn't let you identify magic items. 7th level <I>Arcane sight </I>cannot be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I> spell.<br>

Astral Projection<br>
Necromancy<br>
<B>Level:</B> 9<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 30 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> You plus one additional willing creature touched per two skill score<br>
<B>Duration:</B> See text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether.<br>
You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.<br>
You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.<br>
While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.<br>
You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as <I>dispel magic </I>cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>A jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp, plus a silver bar worth 5 gp for each person to be affected.<br>

<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
An <I>augury </I>can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.<br>
The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the <I>augury </I>succeeds, you get one of four results:<br>
&#149; Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).<br>
&#149; Woe (for bad results).<br>
&#149; Weal and woe (for both).<br>
&#149; Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).<br>
If the spell fails, you get the &#147;nothing&#148; result. If you get the &#147;nothing&#148; result you have no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful <I>augury.<br>
</I>The <I>augury </I>can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All <I>auguries </I>cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as the first casting.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>Incense worth at least 25 gp.<br>
<I>Focus: </I>A set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens of at least 25 gp value.<br>

<B>Target:</B> Animal or tree touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You awaken a tree or animal to humanlike sentience. To succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + the animal's current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened).<br>
The <I>awakened </I>animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.<br>
An <I>awakened </I>tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. An <I>awakened </I>plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human's.<br>
An <I>awakened </I>animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An awakened animal can't serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.<br>
An <I>awakened </I>tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any).<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Permanent<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Fortitude negates, Will partial; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
As <I>polymorph, </I>except that you change the subject into a Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD. If the new form would prove fatal to the creature the subject makes the save with advantage.<br>
If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a Will save. If this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and magical skills, and gains the special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own. It still retains its core and ordinary skills.<br>
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being <I>polymorphed</I>, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A <I>banishment </I>spell is a more powerful version of the <I>dismissal </I>spell. It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished.<br>
You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target's spell resistance (if any), the saving throw DC increases by 2. <br>
Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against spell resistance and increasing the save DC by 4).<br>
<I>Arcane Focus: </I>Any item that is distasteful to the subject (optional, see above).<br>

<I>Barkskin </I>toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every at skill scores 4, 8 and 12, to a maximum of +5.<br>
The enhancement bonus provided by <I>barkskin </I>stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.<br>

The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the usual benefits to hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so forth.<br>
Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's Constitution drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.<br>

You place a curse on the subject. Choose one of the following three effects.<br>
&#149; &#150;6 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).<br>
&#149; &#150;4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks.<br>
&#149; Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.<br>
You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.<br>
The <I>curse </I>bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a <I>break enchantment</I>, <I>limited wish</I>, <I>miracle</I>, <I>remove curse</I>, or <I>wish </I>spell.<br>

Binding<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> One minute<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per two caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> See text (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A <I>binding </I>spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.<br>
You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts <I>suggestion</I>, your caster level for this casting of <I>binding </I>increases by 1. For each assistant who casts <I>dominate animal, dominate person, </I>or <I>dominate monster, </I>your caster level for this casting of <I>binding </I>increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's skill score in the spell cast, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a <I>binding </I>spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <I>binding </I>spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the <I>binding </I>lasts. All <I>binding </I>spells are dismissible.<br>
Regardless of the version of <I>binding </I>you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.<br>
If you are casting any of the first three versions of <I>binding </I>(those with limited durations), you may cast additional <I>binding </I>spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the <I>binding </I>spells it has received are broken.<br>
The <I>binding </I>spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.<br>
<I>Chaining: </I>The subject is confined by restraints that generate an <I>antipathy </I>spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of <I>binding </I>is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.<br>
<I>Slumber: </I>This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while <I>slumbering</I>, nor does it age. This form of <I>binding </I>is more difficult to cast than <I>chaining</I>, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.<br>
<I>Bound Slumber: </I>This combination of <I>chaining </I>and <I>slumber </I>lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.<br>
<I>Hedged Prison: </I>The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.<br>
<I>Metamorphosis: </I>The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <I>binding </I>is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <I>metamorphosed</I>, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.<br>
<I>Minimus Containment: </I>The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The <I>binding </I>is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <I>contained</I>, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.<br>
You can't dispel a <I>binding </I>spell with <I>dispel magic </I>or a similar effect, though an <I>antimagic field </I>or <I>Mage's disjunction </I>affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to <I>dismissal, banishment, </I>or a similar effect.<br>
<I>Components: </I>The components for a <I>binding </I>spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of <I>binding </I>used. These components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals, soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for <I>slumber </I>bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like.<br>
In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of <I>binding </I>(cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.<br>

Black Tentacles<br>
Conjuration (Creation)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot&#151;including water. They grasp and entwine around creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength.<br>
Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the grapple check of the tentacles. Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with an attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19. Thus, its grapple check modifier is equal to your caster level +8. The tentacles are immune to all types of damage.<br>
Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.<br>
Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles. Even creatures who aren't grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Reflex half or Reflex negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force springs into existence. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for half damage.<br>
If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save.<br>
A <I>blade barrier </I>provides cover against attacks made through it.<br>

The effects are cumulative and concurrent.<br>
No saving throw is allowed against these effects.<br>
<I>Dazed: </I>The creature can take no actions for 1 round, though it defends itself normally.<br>
<I>Weakened: </I>The creature's Strength score decreases by 2d6 points for 2d4 rounds.<br>
<I>Paralyzed: </I>The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes.<br>
<I>Killed: </I>Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.<br>
Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonevil extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the <I>blasphemy. </I>The banishment effect allows a Will save (at disadvantage) to negate.<br>
Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected by <I>blasphemy.<br>

This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes. The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing the damage reduction of evil creatures or striking evil incorporeal creatures (though the spell doesn't grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon also becomes good, which means it can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures. (This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the weapon might have.) Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but affected projectile weapons (such as bows) don't confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot.<br>
In addition, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are automatically successful, so every threat is a critical hit. This last effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits, such as a keen weapon or a vorpal sword.<br>

This spell withers a single plant of any size. An affected plant creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and may attempt a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. A plant that isn't a creature doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies.<br>
This spell has no effect on the soil or surrounding plant life.<br>

Blink<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D)<br>
You &#147;blink&#148; back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.<br>
<I>Blinking </I>has several effects, as follows.<br>
Physical attacks against are made at disadvantage, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attacker is capable of seeing invisible creatures and striking ethereal creatures, there is no disadvantage.<br>
Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're <I>blinking </I>unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Likewise, your own spells have a 50% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.<br>
While <I>blinking</I>, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature but you also have a chance to shift to the ethereal plane at random, so your attacks don't have neither advantage nor disadvantage.<br>
You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.<br>
While <I>blinking</I>, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)<br>
Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.<br>
An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.<br>
An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.<br>
Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.<br>

<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting and wavering. Attacks against the subject have disadvantage.<br>
A <I>see invisibility </I>spell does not counteract the <I>blur </I>effect, but a <I>true seeing </I>spell does.<br>
Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).<br>
Attacks that don't rely on sight are immune to this effect, as with blindsight.<br>

Break Enchantment<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 minute<br>

<B>Targets:</B> Up to one creature per level, all within 30 ft. of each other<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> See text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. <I>Break enchantment </I>can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.<br>
If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by <I>dispel magic</I>, <I>break enchantment </I>works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. <br>
If the effect comes from some permanent magic item <I>break enchantment </I>does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects. <br>
