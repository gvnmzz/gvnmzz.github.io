        EXTRAORDINARY SKILLS<br>
    </font>
    <font size="3">
        Extraordinary skills are the result of intense training or innate talent, setting individuals apart in unique
        ways. These abilities are neither mundane nor magical but possess a special quality that elevates them beyond
        the ordinary.
        Extraordinary skills generally cost more Experience Rolls than Ordinary Skills. There are two types of
        Extraordinary skills:<br>

        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
            &#149; Skills that grow in Power as your skill score increase: they can be increased exactly like Ordinary
            skills, but when your skill score increases your options or the power of the skill increases. The skill
            score might be used to calculate something about your power, but it is not the exact number you will be
            using while using that skill.<br>
            &#149; Skills that increase your options just for this once. They don't have a score or a key ability
            associated. They are just one-time skills that you can have or not. They are represented with a dot after
            the black circle (&#9210;&#9210;<B>.</B>)</p>

        <B> Animal Companion (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;)</B>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
            You get an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog,
            eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign
            takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available:
            porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies you on your adventures
            as appropriate for its kind.

            The animal you obtain when you first learn this skill is completely typical for its kind except as noted
            below. As your skill score increases, the animal's power increases as shown on the table. If you release
            your companion from service, you may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted
            hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.

            When your skill reaches higher scores, you may select from alternative lists of animals. Should you select
            an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the skill score
            were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the skill
            score and compare the result with the skill score entry on the table to determine the animal companion's
            powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the effective skill score to 0 or lower, you can't have that animal
            as a companion.)

            An animal companion is different from a normal animal of its kind in many ways. The companion is treated as
            a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects that depend on its type. It is superior to a
            normal animal of its kind and has special powers, as described below.<br>

    <B>Camouflage (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <I>Prerequisite:</I> (&#9210;&#9210;) Favored Terrain [1].<br>
        You can use the Stealth skill in any of your favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or
        concealment.
    </p>


    <B>Crippling Strike (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <I>Prerequisite:</I> (&#9210;&#9210;) Sneak attack [10].<br>
        With this ability you can sneak attack opponents with such precision that your blows weaken and hamper them. An
        opponent damaged by one of your sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to
        damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.
    </p>

    <B>Darkvision (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;"> Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a
        range of 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters
        to see anything that they could not see otherwise—invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still
        visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence
        of light does not spoil darkvision.
    </p>


    <B>Disease Immunity (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;"> You gain immunity to all diseases.
    </p>

    <B>Evasion (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;"> You can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If you makes a
        successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you
        instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor. You do not gain the
        benefit of evasion if you are helpless.
    </p>

    <B>Evasion, Improved (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <I>Prerequisite:</I> (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.) Evasion.<br>
        This ability works like evasion, except that you take only half damage on a failed save.
    </p>

    <B>Fast Movement (&#9210;&#9210;)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;"> For every point you have in this skill, your speed grows of the same number of feet.
        To have Fast Movement +10 ft, you need a skill score of 10;
    </p>

    <B>Favored Enemy (&#9210;&#9210;)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        You select a type of creature from among those given on Table: Favored Enemies. You gain a +2 bonus on
        Perception, Deception, Insight and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type.
        Likewise, you a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.<br>
        When you score reaches 5, 10, 15 and 20 you may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the
        table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just
        selected, if so desired) increases by 2. <br>
        If you choose humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, you must also choose an associated subtype, as
        indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, your bonuses
        do not stack; you simply use whichever bonus is higher.<br>

        Knowledge(geography) checks related to this terrain.<br>
        When you score reaches 5, 10, 15 and 20 you may select an additional favored terrain from those given on the

    <B>Flurry of Blows (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        When unarmored, you may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, you may make
        one extra attack in a round at your highest skill value, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other
        attack made until the start of your next turn.

        When using flurry of blows, you may attack only with unarmed strikes or shortswords or any simple melee weapons
        that don't have the two-handed or heavy property. You may attack with unarmed strikes and the weapons listed
        interchangeably as desired. You can't use any weapon other than thos listed as part of a flurry of blows.

        In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of
        blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, you may still intersperse unarmed strikes
        with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that you have enough attacks in your flurry of blows routine to do so.
    </p>

    <B>Flurry of Blows, Improved (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <I>Prerequisite: </I>(&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.) Flurry of Blows. <br>
        In addition to the standard single extra attack you get from flurry of blows, you get a second extra attack. All
        your attacks, though are made with a -4 malus, until the start of your next turn.

        You can use the Stealth skill in any of your favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or
        concealment.
    </p>

    <B>Low-Light Vision (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;"> Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they
        can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light
        vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light.<br>
        <br>
        Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.

    <B> Unarmed Combat (&#9210;&#9210;)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        Your unarmed damage is 1d6. When the skill score increases your damage increases. You can make an unarmed attack
        even with elbows, knees and feet, so you can attack also with your hands full. You can use either Dexterity or
        Strenght for the Unarmed attack. <br>

    <B>Skill Mastery (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        You become so certain in the use of certain skills that you can use them reliably even under adverse
        conditions.<br>
        <br>
        Upon gaining this ability, you select 3 Mundane skills. When making a skill check with one of these skills, you
        may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent you from doing so. You may gain this special
        ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time.
    </p>

    <B>Slippery Mind (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        You become able to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel you. If you are
        affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fail your saving throw, you can attempt it again 1 round later at
        the same DC. You get only this one extra chance to succeed on your saving throw.
    </p>


    <B>Rage (&#9210;&#9210;)</B>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        You gain a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 bonus to Will saves, but take a -2 penalty
        to Armor Class. Your bonuses increase as the skill score increases. The increase in Constitution increases the
        hit points by 2 points per HD, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when the Constitution score
        drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are). While
        raging, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Acrobatics and
        Intimidate), or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can you cast spells or activate magic
        items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to
        function. You rage for a number of rounds equal to your rage skill score + your Constitution modifier. You may
        end your rage prematurely. <br>

    To use this skill, make a skill check (d20 + Skill Score).<br>
    <B>Success (Roll <= Skill Score):</B> You enter Rage. Apply standard benefits and penalties.<br>
            <B>Failure (Roll > Skill Score):</B> Action wasted. You do not enter Rage.

            <B>Slow Fall (&#9210;)</B>
            <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
                When you fall, provided you are within arm's reach of a wall, you can use it to slow your descent. You
                take
                damage as if your fall were 5ft per skill point shorter than it actually is. When your skill score
                reaches 20,
                you can slow down falls from any distance without harm.
            </p>

            <B>Sneak Attack (&#9210;&#9210;)</B>
            <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
                You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. You can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one
                creature you hit with an attack whenever that creature looses her Dexterity modifier to AC, even though
                the bonus is negative.
                The target must be within 30 feet of you for the attack to deal extra damage. The attack is considered a
                sneak attack also if another enemy of the target is within 5
                feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you can clearly see the target. The extra damage
                increases by 1d6 for every two points you have in the skill after the first one.<br>
            </p>

            <B>Swift Tracker (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>

                <I>Prerequisite: (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.) Woodland Stride </I>
                You can move at your normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. You
                take
                only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while
                tracking.
            </p>

            <B>Trap Sense (&#9210;) </B>
            <p style="margin-left: 15px;"> You get a bonus equal to your skill score divided by three, rounded down, to
                Reflex
                saves made to avoid traps and a to AC against attacks made by traps.
            </p>

            <B>Unarmored (&#9210;&#9210;)</B>
            <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
                When unarmored and unencumbered, you add your Wisdom bonus (if any) to your AC up to the unarmored skill
                value. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to AC for every 5 points you have in this skill (+1 at 5, +2 at
                10, +3 at 15, and +4 at 20).
            </p>

            <p style="margin-left: 15px;"> You have a keen sense for danger, and retein your Dexterity bonus to AC even
                if you are flat-footed or attacked by an invisible attacker.
            </p>

            <B>Venom Immunity (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
            <p style="margin-left: 15px;"> You gain immunity to all poisons.
            </p>

            <B>Wild Empathy (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
            <p style="margin-left: 15px;">You can improve the attitude of an animal using the Persuasion skill. The
                typical
                domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To
                use wild
                empathy, You and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that you must be within 30
                feet of one
                another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as
                with
                influencing people, it might take more or less time. <br>
                You can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but you
                do so
                with disadvantage.
            </p>

            <B>Woodland Stride (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
            <p style="margin-left: 15px;"> You may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars,
                overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any
                other
                impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede
                motion
                still affect you.
