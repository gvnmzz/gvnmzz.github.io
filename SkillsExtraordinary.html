EXTRAORDINARY SKILLS<br>
</font><font size="3">
Extraordinary skills are the result of intense training or innate talent, setting individuals apart in unique ways. These abilities are neither mundane nor magical but possess a special quality that elevates them beyond the ordinary.
Extraordinary skills generally cost more Experience Rolls than Ordinary Skills. There are two types of Extraordinary skills:<br>

<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
&#149; Skills that grow in Power as your skill score increase: they can be increased exactly like Ordinary skills, but when your skill score increases your options or the power of the skill increases. The skill score might be used to calculate something about your power, but it is not the exact number you will be using while using that skill.<br>
&#149; Skills that increase your options just for this once. They don't have a score or a key ability associated. They are just one-time skills that you can have or not. They are represented with a dot after the black circle (&#9210;&#9210;<B>.</B>)</p></font>

    SKILLS DESCRIPTIONS<br>
    </font><font size="3"><br>

<B> Animal Companion (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    You get an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies you  on your adventures as appropriate for its kind.

    The animal you obtain when you first learn this skill is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As your skill score increases, the animal's power increases as shown on the table. If you release your companion from service, you may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.
    
    When your skill reaches higher scores, you may select from alternative lists of animals. Should you select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the skill score were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the skill score and compare the result with the skill score entry on the table to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the effective skill score to 0 or lower, you can't have that animal as a companion.)
    
    An animal companion is different from a normal animal of its kind in many ways. The companion is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects that depend on its type. It is superior to a normal animal of its kind and has special powers, as described below.<br>

<B>Camouflage (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> 
   <I>Prerequisite:</I> (&#9210;&#9210;) Favored Terrain [1].<br>
   You can use the Stealth skill in any of your favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.
</p>


<B>Crippling Strike (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> 
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> (&#9210;&#9210;) Sneak attack [10].<br>
    With this ability you can sneak attack opponents with such precision that your blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of your sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.
    <I>Strength or Dexterity Pool Points cost (1)</I>
</p>

<B>Disease Immunity (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> You gain immunity to all diseases.
</p>

<B>Evasion (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> You can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If you makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor. You do not gain the benefit of evasion if you are helpless.
    <I>Dexterity Pool Points cost (1)</I>
</p>

<B>Evasion, Improved (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> 
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.) Evasion.<br>
    This ability works like evasion, except that you take only half damage on a failed save.
    <I>Dexterity Pool Points cost (1)</I>
</p>
        
<B>Fast Movement (&#9210;&#9210;)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> For every point you have in this skill, your speed grows of the same number of feet. To have Fast Movement +10 ft, you need a skill score of 10;
</p>

<B>Favored Enemy (&#9210;&#9210;)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    You select a type of creature from among those given on Table: Favored Enemies. You gain a +2 bonus on Perception, Deception, Insight and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, you a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.<br>
    When you score reaches 5, 10, 15 and 20 you may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. <br>
    If you choose humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, you must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, your bonuses do not stack; you simply use whichever bonus is higher.<br>

<B>Flurry of Blows (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> 
    When unarmored, you may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, you may make one extra attack in a round at your highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made until the start of your next turn.

    When using flurry of blows, you may attack only with unarmed strikes or shortswords or any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property. You may attack with unarmed strikes and the weapons listed interchangeably as desired. You can't use any weapon other than thos listed as part of a flurry of blows.
    
    In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, you may still intersperse unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that you have enough attacks in your flurry of blows routine to do so.
</p>

<B>Flurry of Blows, Improved (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> 
    <I>Prerequisite: </I>(&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.) Flurry of Blows. <br>
    In addition to the standard single extra attack you get from flurry of blows, you get a second extra attack. All your attacks, though are made with a -4 malus, until the start of your next turn.

<B> Unarmed Combat (&#9210;&#9210;)</B>
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">
    Your unarmed damage is 1d6. When the skill score increases your damage increases. You can make an unarmed attack even with elbows, knees and feet, so you can attack also with your hands full. You can use either Dexterity or Strenght for the Unarmed attack. <br>

<B>Opportunist (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> 
    <I>Prerequisite:</I> 
    You can use your reaction to make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character.
    <I>Dexterity Pool Points cost (1):</I> when you use this skill you use up one Point from your Dexterity Pool. If there are not enough points in the Dexterity Pool, you fail to use use the skill.
</p>

<B>Skill Mastery (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> 
   You become so certain in the use of certain skills that you can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.<br>
   <br>
   Upon gaining this ability, you select 3 Mundane skills. When making a skill check with one of these skills, you may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent you from doing so. You may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time.
</p>

<B>Slippery Mind (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> 
    You become able to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel you. If you are affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fail your saving throw, you can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. You get only this one extra chance to succeed on your saving throw.

    You gain a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 bonus to Will saves, but take a -2 penalty to Armor Class. Your bonuses increase as the skill score increases. The increase in Constitution increases the hit points by 2 points per HD, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when the Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are). While raging, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Acrobatics and Intimidate), or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can you cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. You rage for a number of rounds equal to your rage skill score + your Constitution modifier. You may end your rage prematurely. <br>

The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. The extra damage increases by 1d6 for every two points you have in the skill after the first one.<br>

</p>

<B>Uncanny Dodge (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B>

<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> You gain immunity to all poisons.
</p>

<B>Wild Empathy (&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;">You can improve the attitude of an animal using the Persuasion skill. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, You and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that you must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. <br>
You can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but you do so with disadvantage.
</p>

<B>Woodland Stride (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;.)</B> 
<p style="margin-left: 15px;"> You may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect you.
