HAG<br>
</font><font size="3">Although different hags are unique in appearance and mannerism, they have many aspects in common. All take the form of crones whose bent shapes belie their fierce power and swiftness.<br>
Hags speak Giant and Common.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Hags are tremendously strong. They are naturally resistant to spells and can cast magic of their own. Hags often gather to form coveys. A covey, usually containing one hag of each type, can use powers beyond those of the individual members.<br>

An annis commonly uses its <I>disguise self </I>ability to take the form of an exceptionally tall human, a fair giant, or an ogre.<br>
An annis stands some 8 feet tall and weighs about 325 pounds.<br>
Combat<br>
Though physically powerful, these hags do not favor simple assaults but try to divide and confuse their foes before combat. They love to pose as commoners or gentlefolk to lull their victims into a sense of false security before they attack.<br>
<B>Improved Grab (Ex):</B> To use this ability, an annis must hit a Large or smaller opponent with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.<br>
<B>Rake (Ex):</B> Attack bonus +13 melee, damage 1d6+7. An annis can attack a grappled foe with both claws at no penalty.<br>
<B>Rend (Ex): </B>An annis that hits with both claw attacks latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an extra 2d6+10 points of damage.<br>

The sea hag is found in the water of seas or overgrown lakes.<br>
A sea hag is about the same height and weight as a female human.<br>
Combat<br>
Sea hags are not subtle and prefer a direct approach to combat.<br>
They usually remain in hiding until they can affect as many foes as possible with their horrific appearance.<br>
<B>Horrific Appearance (Su):</B> The sight of a sea hag is so revolting that anyone (other than another hag) who sets eyes upon one must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or instantly be weakened, taking 2d6 points of Strength damage. This damage cannot reduce a victim's Strength score below 0, but anyone reduced to Strength 0 is helpless. Creatures that are affected by this power or that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same hag's horrific appearance for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.<br>
<B>Evil Eye (Su): </B>Three times per day, a sea hag can cast its dire gaze upon any single creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be dazed for three days, although <I>remove curse </I>or <I>dispel evil </I>can restore sanity sooner. In addition, an affected creature must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or die from fright. Creatures with immunity to fear effects are not affected by the sea hag's evil eye. The save DCs are Charisma-based.<br>
<B>Amphibious (Ex):</B> Although sea hags are aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land.<br>
<B>Skills:</B> A sea hag has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.<br>
<br>
HAG COVEY<br>
From time to time, a trio of hags gathers as a covey. Usually this foul triune includes one hag of each type, but this is not always the case.<br>
Combat<br>
Hags in a covey rely on deception and their boosted magical abilities in combat.<br>
A covey of hags is 80% likely to be guarded by 1d8 ogres and 1d4 evil giants who do their bidding. These minions are often disguised with a <I>veil </I>spell to appear less threatening and sent forth as spies. Such minions often (60%) carry magic stones known as <I>hag eyes </I>(see below).<br>
<B>Spell-Like Abilities:</B> 3/day&#151;<I>animate dead, bestow curse </I>(DC 17)<I>, control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank, mirage arcana </I>(DC 18)<I>, polymorph, veil </I>(DC 19)<I>, vision. </I>Caster level 9th. The save DCs are based on a Charisma score of 16. To use one of these abilities (which requires a full-round action), all three hags must be within 10 feet of one another, and all must participate.<br>
Once per month, a covey that does not have a <I>hag eye </I>can create one from a gem worth at least 20 gp (see below).<br>
<br>
Hag Eye<br>
A <I>hag eye </I>is a magic gem created by a covey. It appears to be nothing more than a semiprecious stone, but a <I>gem of seeing </I>or other such effect reveals it as a disembodied eye. Often, a <I>hag eye </I>is worn as a ring, brooch, or other adornment. Any of the three hags who created the <I>hag eye </I>can see through it whenever they wish, so long as it is on the same plane of existence as the hag. A <I>hag eye </I>has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. Destroying a <I>hag eye </I>deals 1d10 points of damage to each member of the covey and causes the one who sustained the greatest damage to be blinded for 24 hours. <br>

HALF-CELESTIAL<br>
</font><font size="3">No matter the form, half-celestials are always comely and delightful to the senses, having golden skin, sparkling eyes, angelic wings, or some other sign of their higher nature. <br>
CREATING A HALF-CELESTIAL<br>
&#147;Half-celestial&#148; is an inherited template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or higher and nonevil alignment (referred to hereafter as the base creature).<br>
A half-celestial uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br>
<B>Size and Type:</B> The creature's type changes to outsider. Do not recalculate the creature's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, or saves. Size is unchanged. Half-celestials are normally native outsiders.<br>
<B>Speed:</B> A half-celestial has feathered wings and can fly at twice the base creature's base land speed (good maneuverability). If the base creature has a fly speed, use that instead.<br>
<B>Armor Class:</B> Natural armor improves by +1 (this stacks with any natural armor bonus the base creature has).<br>
<B>Special Attacks:</B> A half-celestial retains all the special attacks of the base creature and also gains the following special abilities. <br>
<I>Daylight (Su): </I>Half-celestials can use a <I>daylight </I>effect (as the spell) at will.<br>
<I>Smite Evil (Su): </I>Once per day a half-celestial can make a normal melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of +20) against an evil foe.<br>
<B>Spell-Like Abilities:</B> A half-celestial with an Intelligence or Wisdom score of 8 or higher has two or more spell-like abilities, depending on its Hit Dice, as indicated on the table below. The abilities are cumulative<I><br>
</I>Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster level equals the creature's HD, and the save DC is Charisma-based.<br>

&#151;Spell resistance equal to creature's HD + 10 (maximum 35).<br>

Do not include Hit Dice from class levels in this calculation&#151;the half-celestial gains outsider skill points only for its racial Hit Dice, and gains the normal amount of skill points for its class levels.

HALF-DRAGON<br>

CREATING A HALF-DRAGON<br>
&#147;Half-dragon&#148; is an inherited template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature).<br>
A half-dragon uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br>
<B>Size and Type:</B> The creature's type changes to dragon. Size is unchanged. Do not recalculate base attack bonus or saves.<br>
<B>Hit Dice:</B> Increase base creature's racial HD by one die size, to a maximum of d12. Do not increase class HD.<br>
<B>Speed:</B> A half-dragon that is Large or larger has wings and can fly at twice its base land speed (maximum 120 ft.) with average maneuverability. A half-dragon that is Medium or smaller does not have wings.<br>
<B>Armor Class:</B> Natural armor improves by +4. <br>
<B>Attack: </B>A half-dragon has two claw attacks and a bite attack, and the claws are the primary natural weapon. If the base creature can use weapons, the half-dragon retains this ability. A half-dragon fighting without weapons uses a claw when making an attack action. When it has a weapon, it usually uses the weapon instead.<br>
<B>Full Attack:</B> A half-dragon fighting without weapons uses both claws and its bite when making a full attack. If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack and its bite as a natural secondary attack. If it has a hand free, it uses a claw as an additional natural secondary attack.<br>
<B>Damage:</B> Half-dragons have bite and claw attacks. If the base creature does not have these attack forms, use the damage values in the table below. Otherwise, use the values below or the base creature's damage values, whichever are greater.<br>

HALF-FIEND<br>
</font><font size="3">No matter its form, a half-fiend is always hideous to behold, having dark scales, horns, glowing red eyes, bat wings, a fetid odor, or some other obvious sign that it is tainted with evil.<br>
CREATING A HALF-FIEND<br>
&#147;Half-fiend&#148; is an inherited template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or more and nongood alignment (referred to hereafter as the base creature).<br>
A half-fiend uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br>
<B>Size and Type: </B>The creature's type changes to outsider. Do not recalculate Hit Dice, base attack bonus, or saves. Size is unchanged. Half-fiends are normally native outsiders.<br>
<B>Speed:</B> A half-fiend has bat wings. Unless the base creature has a better fly speed, the creature can fly at the base creature's base land speed (average maneuverability).<br>
<B>Armor Class:</B> Natural armor improves by +1 (this stacks with any natural armor bonus the base creature has).<br>
<B>Attack:</B> A half-fiend has two claw attacks and a bite attack, and the claws are the primary natural weapon. If the base creature can use weapons, the half-fiend retains this ability. A half-fiend fighting without weapons uses a claw when making an attack action. When it has a weapon, it usually uses the weapon instead.<br>
<B>Full Attack:</B> A half-fiend fighting without weapons uses both claws and its bite when making a full attack. If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack and its bite as a natural secondary attack. If it has a hand free, it uses a claw as an additional natural secondary attack.<br>
<B>Damage: </B>Half-fiends have bite and claw attacks. If the base creature does not have these attack forms, use the damage values in the table below. Otherwise, use the values below or the base creature's damage values, whichever are greater.<br>

Halflings stand about 3 feet tall and usually weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. They have brown or black eyes. Halfling men often have long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches almost unseen. Halflings prefer simple, comfortable, and practical clothes. Unlike members of most races, they prefer actual comfort to shows of wealth. Halflings reach adulthood in their early twenties and generally live into the middle of their second century. Halflings speak Halfling and Common.<br>
Most halflings encountered outside their home are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Halflings prefer to fight defensively, usually hiding and launching ranged attacks as the foe approaches. Their tactics are very much like those of elves but place more emphasis on cover and concealment and less on mobility.<br>
<B>Halfling Traits (Ex):</B> Halflings possess the following racial traits.<br>
&#151; +2 Dexterity, &#150;2 Strength.<br>
&#151;Small size. +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls, +4 bonus on Hide checks, &#150;4 penalty on grapple checks, lifting and carrying limits 3/4 those of Medium characters.<br>
&#151;A halfling's base land speed is 20 feet.<br>
&#151; +2 racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move Silently checks.<br>
&#151; +1 racial bonus on all saving throws.<br>
&#151; +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. This bonus stacks with the halfling's +1 bonus on saving throws in general. <br>
&#151; +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with thrown weapons and<br>
slings.<br>
&#151; +2 racial bonus on Listen checks.<br>
&#151;Automatic Languages: Common, Halfling. Bonus Languages: Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Goblin, Orc.<br>
&#151;Favored Class: Rogue.<br>
The halfling warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.<br>
<br>
SUBRACES<br>
The information above is for the lightfoot halfling, the most common halfling variety. There are two other major halfling subraces, which differ from lightfoot halflings as follows.<br>
<br>
<B>Tallfellow<br>
</B>Tallfellows are somewhat rare among halfling folk. Tallfellows are 4 feet tall or more and weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. They generally speak Elven in addition to Common and Halfling. <br>
<B>Tallfellow Traits (Ex):</B> These traits are in addition to the lightfoot halfling traits, except where noted.<br>
&#151; +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks. Like an elf, a tallfellow who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check as though actively looking for it. This trait replaces the lightfoot's +2 bonus on Listen checks.<br>
&#151;Tallfellows are less athletic than lightfoot halflings and do not have a racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move Silently checks.<br>
<br>
<B>Deep Halfling<br>
</B>These halflings are shorter and stockier than the more common lightfeet.<br>
Deep halflings are about 2-1/2 tall and weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. Deep halflings speak Dwarven fluently.<br>
<B>Deep Halfling Traits (Ex):</B> These traits are in addition to the lightfoot halfling traits, except where noted.<br>
&#151;Darkvision out to 60 feet.<br>
&#151;Stonecunning: Like dwarves, deep halflings have a +2 racial bonus on checks to notice unusual stonework. Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A deep halfling who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a check as though actively searching and can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A deep halfling can also intuit depth, sensing the approximate distance underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.<br>
&#151; +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks and Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.<br>
&#151;Deep halflings are less athletic than lightfoot halflings and do not have a racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move Silently checks.<br>

Harpies like to entrance hapless travelers with their magical songs and lead them to unspeakable torments. Only when a harpy has finished playing with its new &#147;toys&#148; will it release them from suffering by killing and consuming them.<br>
COMBAT<br>
When a harpy engages in battle, it prefers to use Flyby Attack and strike with a melee weapon.<br>
<B>Captivating Song (Su):</B> The most insidious ability of the harpy is its song. When a harpy sings, all creatures (other than harpies) within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become captivated. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same harpy's song for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. <br>
A captivated victim walks toward the harpy, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, or the like), that creature gets a second saving throw. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. (Thus, a fighter cannot run away or attack but takes no defensive penalties.) A victim within 5 feet of the harpy stands there and offers no resistance to the monster's attacks. The effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round thereafter. A bard's countersong ability allows the captivated creature to attempt a new Will save.<br>
<B>Skills:</B> Harpies have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Listen checks.<br>

A typical hell hound stands 4-1/2 feet high at the shoulder and weighs 120 pounds.<br>
Hell hounds do not speak but understand Infernal.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Hell hounds are efficient hunters. A favorite pack tactic is to surround prey quietly, then attack with one or two hounds, driving it toward the rest with their fiery breath. If the prey doesn't run, the pack closes in. Hell hounds track fleeing prey relentlessly.<br>
A hell hound's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned<br>
and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br>
<B>Breath Weapon (Su): </B>10-foot cone, once every 2d4 rounds, damage 2d6 fire, Reflex DC 13 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.<br>
<B>Fiery Bite (Su):</B> A hell hound deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage every time it bites an opponent, as if its bite were a flaming weapon.<br>
<B>Skills:</B> Hell hounds have a +5 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.<br>
*They also receive a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent, due to their keen sense of smell.<br>

Hippogriffs are aggressive flying creatures that combine features of horses and giant eagles. Voracious omnivores, hippogriffs will hunt humanoids as readily as any other meal. A typical hippogriff is 9 feet long, has a wingspan of 20 feet, and weighs 1,000 pounds.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Hippogriffs dive at their prey and strike with their clawed forelegs. When they cannot dive, they slash with claws and beak. Mated pairs and flights of these creatures attack in concert, diving repeatedly to drive away or kill intruders. Hippogriffs fight to the death to defend their nests and their hatchlings, which are prized as aerial mounts and fetch a handsome price in many civilized areas.<br>
<B>Skills:</B> Hippogriffs have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.<br>
TRAINING A HIPPOGRIFF<br>
A hippogriff requires training before it can bear a rider in combat.<br>
Training a hippogriff requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a hippogriff requires an exotic saddle. A hippogriff can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. <br>
Hippogriff eggs are worth 2,000 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a hippogriff.<br>
<B>Carrying Capacity:</B> A light load for a hippogriff is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301&#150;600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601&#150;900 pounds.<br>

A homunculus is a miniature servant created by a wizard. These creatures are weak combatants but make effective spies, messengers, and scouts. A homunculus's creator determines its precise features. Homunculi are little more than tools designed to carry out assigned tasks. They are extensions of their creators, sharing the same alignment and basic nature. A homunculus cannot speak, but the process of creating one links it telepathically with its creator.<br>
It knows what its master knows and can convey to him or her everything it sees and hears, out to a distance of 1,500 feet. A homunculus never travels beyond this range willingly, though it can be removed forcibly. If this occurs, the creature does everything in its power to regain contact with its master. An attack that destroys a homunculus deals 2d10 points of damage to its master.<br>
If the creature's master is slain, the homunculus also dies, and its body swiftly melts away into a pool of ichor.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Homunculi land on their victims and bite with their venomous fangs.<br>
<B>Poison (Ex):</B> Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage sleep for 1 minute, secondary damage sleep for another 5d6 minutes. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.<br>
CONSTRUCTION<br>
A homunculus is shaped from a mixture of clay, ashes, mandrake root, spring water, and one pint of the creator's own blood. The materials cost 50 gp. The creature's master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. Creating the body requires a DC 12 Craft (sculpting) check or a DC 12 Craft (pottery) check.<br>
After the body is sculpted, it is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and ritual can be performed together.<br>
A homunculus with more than 2 Hit Dice can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds +2,000 gp to the cost to create. <br>
Craft Construct, <I>arcane eye, mirror image, mending, </I>caster must be at least 4th level; Price &#151; (never sold); Cost 1,050 gp + 78 XP.<br>

Howlers live on planes where chaos and evil hold sway. A howler is about 8 feet long and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Although they are surprisingly intelligent, howlers do not speak&#151;they only howl. If there is a language within the howls, as some have suggested, even spells cannot decipher it. Howlers understand Abyssal.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Howlers attack in groups, for they are cowardly and cruel. They prefer to charge into combat, race out, and then charge in again. A howler's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br>
<B>Quills (Ex):</B> A howler's neck bristles with long quills. While biting, the creature thrashes about, striking with 1d4 of them. An opponent hit by a howler's quill attack must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or have the quill break off in his or her flesh. Lodged quills impose a &#150;1 penalty on attacks, saves, and checks per quill. The save DC is Dexterity-based.<br>
A quill can be removed safely with a DC 20 Heal check; otherwise, removing a quill deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.<br>
<B>Howl (Ex):</B> All beings other than outsiders that hear the creature's howling for an hour or longer are subject to its effect, though it does not help the howler in combat. Anyone within hearing range of a howler for a full hour must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or take 1 point of Wisdom damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. The save must be repeated for each hour of exposure. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect.<br>
TRAINING A HOWLER<br>
Although intelligent, a howler requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a howler must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly howler requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a howler requires an exotic saddle. A howler can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.<br>
<B>Carrying Capacity:</B> A light load for a howler is up to 460 pounds; a medium load, 461&#150;920 pounds; and a heavy load, 921&#150;1,380 pounds. A howler can drag 6,900 pounds. <br>

Hydras are reptile-like monsters with multiple heads. A hydra is gray-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow or tan underbelly. The eyes are amber and the teeth are yellow-white. It is about 20 feet long and weighs about 4,000 pounds. Hydras do not speak.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if they move or charge during the round.<br>
A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or by slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must make a successful sunder attempt with a slashing weapon. (The player should declare where the attack is aimed before making the attack roll.) Making a sunder attempt provokes an attack of opportunity unless the foe has the Improved Sunder feat. An opponent can strike at a hydra's heads from any position in which he could strike at the hydra itself, because the hydra's head writhe and whip about in combat. An opponent can ready an action to attempt to sunder a hydra's head when the creature bites at him. Each of a hydra's heads has hit points equal to the creature's full normal hit point total, divided by its original number of heads. Losing a head deals damage to the body equal to half the head's full normal hit points. A natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss. A hydra can no longer attack with a severed head but takes no other penalties.<br>
Each time a head is severed, two new heads spring from the stump in 1d4 rounds. A hydra can never have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time, and any extra heads it gains beyond its original number wither and die within a day. To prevent a severed head from growing back into two heads, at least 5 points of fire or acid damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before the new heads appear. A flaming weapon (or similar effect) deals its energy damage to the stump in the same blow in which a head is severed. Fire or acid damage from an area effect may burn multiple stumps in addition to dealing damage to the hydra's body. A hydra does not die from losing its heads until all its heads have been cut off and the stumps seared by fire or acid. <br>
A hydra's body can be slain just like any other creature's, but hydras possess fast healing (see below) and are difficult to defeat in this fashion. Any attack that is not (or cannot be) an attempt to sunder a head affects the body.<br>
Targeted magical effects cannot sever a hydra's heads (and thus must be directed at the body) unless they deal slashing damage and could be used to make sunder attempts.<br>
<B>Fast Healing (Ex):</B> Each round, a hydra heals damage equal to 10 + the number of its original heads. <br>
<B>Skills: </B>Hydras have a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks, thanks to their multiple heads.<br>
A hydra has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.<br>
<B>Feats:</B> A hydra's Combat Reflexes feat allows it to use all its heads for attacks of opportunity.<br>
<br>
PYROHYDRA<br>
Huge Magical Beast (Fire)<br>
These reddish hydras can breathe jets of fire 10 feet high, 10 feet wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once every 1d4 rounds. Each jet deals 3d6 points of fire damage per head. A successful Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 hydra's original number of heads + hydra's Con modifier.<br>
Fire attacks cannot prevent a pyrohydra's stump from growing new heads (since a pyrohydra has immunity to fire), but 5 points of cold damage does.<br>
<br>
CRYOHYDRA<br>
Huge Magical Beast (Cold)<br>
These purplish hydras can breathe jets of frost 10 feet high, 10 feet wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once every 1d4 rounds. Each jet deals 3d6 points of cold damage per head. A successful Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 hydra's original number of heads + hydra's Con modifier.<br>
Cold attacks cannot prevent a cryohydra's stump from growing new heads (since a cryohydra has immunity to cold), but 5 points of fire damage does.<br>
<font size="5"><br>
INEVITABLE<br>
</font><font size="3">Inevitables are constructs whose sole aim is to enforce the natural laws of the universe.<br>
Each type of inevitable is designed to find and punish a particular kind of transgression, hunting down a person or group that has violated a fundamental principle. When an inevitable is created, it receives its first mission, then finds the transgressors and metes out appropriate punishment. The sentence is usually death, although some inevitables insist on compensation to the wronged party instead, using <I>geas </I>and <I>mark of justice </I>to ensure compliance. From its first step, an inevitable focuses totally on its target. It continues its efforts no matter how cold the trail or hopeless the task. Inevitables are single-minded in pursuit of their quarry, but they are under orders to leave innocents alone. Accomplices to their prey are fair game, however, which sometimes creates conflicts within their programming. <br>
Inevitables gladly sacrifice themselves to complete a mission, but they aren't suicidal. Faced with impending defeat, they are likely to withdraw and seek a way to even the odds. They are determined but patient foes. They ally with others if that helps accomplish their mission, but they have a hard time keeping allies for long.<br>
Inevitables tend to stick out in a crowd while they're in observation mode, but they seem oblivious to the attention. Their forms vary, but all inevitables are gold-and-silver clockwork creatures, with gears and pistons where muscles would be on flesh-and-blood creatures. Their eyes glow with a golden radiance.<br>
Note that unlike most constructs, inevitables have an Intelligence score and can think, learn, and remember.<br>
Inevitables speak Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and the native language of their first target.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Unless their very existence is threatened, inevitables focus completely on the transgressor they've been assigned to, ignoring other combatants completely. An inevitable might attack anyone who hinders its progress, but it won't tarry beyond the point where it can reengage its quarry. Inevitables take self-defense very seriously; anyone who attacks an inevitable with what the creature perceives as deadly force is met with deadly force in return.<br>
An inevitable's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br>
<B>Fast Healing (Ex): </B>An inevitable heals a certain amount of damage each round (specified in each variety's description) as long as it has at least 1 hit point. However, damage dealt by chaotic weapons heals at the normal rate.<br>

Kolyaruts mete out punishment to those who break bargains and oaths. <br>
Before beginning a mission against a deal-breaker, a kolyarut learns as much about the contract or oath as possible. It's not interested in those who break deals accidentally or against their will&#151; only those who willingly break contracts violate the principle that kolyaruts are created to uphold. If a written contract was broken, the kolyarut typically carries a copy of the contract with it.<br>
Kolyaruts are the most talkative of the inevitables, making credible attempts at social niceties such as proper greetings before getting down to the matter at hand. They can use <I>disguise self </I>to appear as almost any kind of humanoid&#151;useful if they need to go undercover to catch their quarry.<br>
Combat<br>
Like all inevitables, a kolyarut is patient enough to study a target before striking. It has a good idea of the deal-breaker's abilities and defenses before it enters battle. When it fights, it tries to get the conflict over as soon as possible, minimizing excess bloodshed and mayhem. It doesn't let concern for innocents delay or endanger its mission, however.<br>
A kolyarut's favorite tactic is to use <I>invisibility </I>or <I>disguise self </I>to sneak close, then eliminate the quarry with its vampiric touch ability before it can react. A kolyarut has no compunctions about using its vampiric touch ability on allies to increase its own power, if doing so helps it complete its mission.<br>
A kolyarut's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br>
<B>Enervation Ray (Su):</B> A kolyarut can fire a black enervation ray at targets within 200 feet. The effect is identical with the <I>enervation </I>spell (caster level 13th).<br>
<B>Spell-Like Abilities:</B> At will&#151;<I>discern lies </I>(DC 17)<I>, disguise self, fear </I>(DC 17)<I>, hold person </I>(DC 16)<I>, invisibility, locate creature, suggestion </I>(DC 16)<I>; </I>1/day&#151;<I>hold monster </I>(DC 17)<I>, mark of justice; </I>1/week&#151; <I>geas/quest. </I>Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.<br>
<B>Vampiric Touch (Su): </B>As a melee touch attack, a kolyarut can steal life force from its foe, as the <I>vampiric touch </I>spell (caster level 13th).<br>
<B>Skills: </B>A kolyarut has a +4 racial bonus on Disguise, Gather Information, and Sense Motive checks.<br>

Maruts confront those who would try to deny the grave itself.<br>
Any who use unnatural means to extend their life span could be targeted by a marut. Those who take extraordinary measures to cheat death in some other way might be labeled transgressors as well. Those who use magic to reverse death aren't worthy of a marut's attention unless they do so repeatedly or on a massive scale.<br>
When a marut has identified its target, it walks surely and implacably toward the foe, never resting.<br>
Combat<br>
Once it has found its target, a marut brings it the death it has been trying to avoid. Those who defile death through necromancy may instead receive a <I>geas </I>and/or <I>mark of justice </I>to enforce proper respect. It typically uses <I>wall of force </I>to shut off any escape routes, then opens up with <I>chain lightning </I>while it closes to melee range. Once there, it strikes with its massive fists, using <I>circle of death </I>if beset by numbers of defenders. It hits spellcasting opponents with repeated uses of <I>greater dispel magic, </I>and it uses <I>dimension door </I>and <I>locate creature </I>to track down foes who flee.<br>
A marut's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br>
<B>Fists of Thunder and Lightning (Su):</B> A marut's left fist delivers a loud thunderclap whenever it hits something, dealing an extra 3d6 points of sonic damage and causing the target to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 31 negates the deafness). Its right fist delivers a shock for an extra 3d6 points of electricity damage, and the flash of lightning causes the target to be blinded for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 31 negates the blindness). The save DCs are Strength-based and include the marut's Ability Focus feat.<br>
<B>Spell-Like Abilities:</B> At will&#151;<I>air walk, dimension door, fear </I>(DC 18)<I>, greater command </I>(DC 19)<I>, greater dispel magic, mass inflict light wounds </I>(DC 19), <I>locate creature, true seeing; </I>1/day&#151;<I>chain lightning </I>(DC 20)<I>, circle of death </I>(DC 20)<I>, mark of justice, wall of force; </I>1/week&#151; <I>earthquake </I>(DC 22)<I>, geas/quest, plane shift </I>(DC 21)<I>. </I>Caster level 14th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.<br>
<B>Skills:</B> A marut has a +4 racial bonus on Concentration, Listen, and Spot checks.<br>

Zelekhuts are charged with hunting down those who would deny justice&#151;especially those who flee to escape punishment. Expert trackers, they use a combination of natural skill and magic to find fugitives wherever they may hide.<br>
A zelekhut may initially appear rather non-threatening&#151;but when it is about to enter combat, it can cause two spiked chains to spring forth from its forearms as a free action. In similar fashion, it can cause a pair of golden metallic wings to emerge from its back. Retracting the chains or the wings is also a free action.<br>
Combat<br>
Once it has found its fugitive, a zelekhut uses its speed and its spell-like abilities to cover the most likely escape routes. Then it immobilizes any defenders while attempting to protect any innocent bystanders. Finally, it apprehends the fugitive with its spiked chains, tripping or disarming the foe as needed.<br>
A zelekhut's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br>

Invisible stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air. They sometimes serve wizards and sorcerers, who summon them to perform specific tasks.<br>
A summoned invisible stalker undertakes whatever task the summoner commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away. The creature follows a command until the task is completed and obeys only the summoner. However, it resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to pervert its instructions accordingly.<br>
Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A <I>see invisibility </I>spell shows only a dim outline of a cloud, while a <I>true seeing </I>spell reveals a roiling cloud of vapor.<br>
These creatures speak only Auran but can understand Common.<br>
COMBAT<br>
An invisible stalker attacks by using the air itself as a weapon. It creates a sudden, intense blast of wind that pounds a single target on the same plane as the creature.<br>
An invisible stalker can be killed only when it is on the Elemental Plane of Air. When performing a task elsewhere, it automatically returns to its home plane when it takes damage sufficient to destroy it.<br>
<B>Natural Invisibility (Su):</B> This ability is constant, allowing a stalker to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject to the <I>invisibility purge </I>spell.<br>
<B>Improved Tracking (Ex):</B> An invisible stalker is a consummate tracker and makes Spot checks instead of the usual Survival checks to trace a creature's passage.<br>
