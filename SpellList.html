<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close <br>
<B>Effect:</B> One missile of acid<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> AC<br>
You fire a small orb of acid at the target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The orb deals 1d3 points of acid damage.<br>

Alarm <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Area:</B> 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 3 hours (dismissible)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<I>Alarm</I> creates a magical ward that detects intrusion. It triggers when a creature of Tiny or larger size enters or touches the area. You choose whether the <I>alarm</I> is audible or mental when casting. Creatures that speak a designated password (set during casting) do not trigger the <I>alarm</I>.<br>
<I>Mental Alarm:</I> Alerts only you, provided you're within 1 mile. The signal is a single mental ping that awakens you from sleep but does not otherwise disturb you. It functions even in a <I>silence</I> spell.<br>
<I>Audible Alarm:</I> Produces a clear ringing (like a hand bell) that lasts 1 round and is heard within 60 feet. Closed doors reduce this distance by 10 feet; walls reduce it by 20 feet. In quiet conditions, it may be faintly heard up to 180 feet away. The ringing is blocked by a <I>silence</I> spell.<br>
Ethereal and astral creatures do not trigger the <I>alarm</I>.<br>
This spell is cast through your focus, allowing you to ward an area without touching it.<br>
<I>Alarm</I> may be made permanent with a <I>permanency</I> spell.<br>
<b>Special:</b> This spell is not affected by Magic Resistance.<br><br>

Alter Self <br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Self<br>
<B>Targets:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form. The new form must be within one size category of your normal size. You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.<br>
You retain your own core skills. You retain all supernatural and spell-like skills of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).<br>
You keep all extraordinary skill, but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived fromt raining.<br>
If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.<br>
You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.<br>
You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.<br>
You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form. Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form. You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.<br>
You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.<br>
When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its true form.<br>

<B>Animate Dead</B><br>
Necromancy [Evil]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One or more corpses touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell animates corpses into skeletons or zombies that obey your spoken commands. You can direct them to follow you or to remain in a location and attack intruders. They remain animated until destroyed and cannot be reanimated again.<br>
You can animate up to <B>10 Hit Dice (HD)</B> worth of undead. You choose the mix of skeletons and zombies, but must meet the anatomical requirements (see below).<br>
Although the undead are permanent, you can only control a number of undead whose combined total HD does not exceed <B>4 x your skill score</B>. If this limit is exceeded, you choose which undead remain under your command; the rest become uncontrolled.<br>
<I>Skeletons:</I> require a mostly intact corpse with bones. If the body has flesh, it falls away as the spell takes effect.<br>
<I>Zombies:</I> require a mostly intact corpse of a creature with a true anatomy (flesh and organs).<br>
<I>Material:</I> A black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per HD of the undead must be placed into each corpse's mouth or eye socket. These gems are consumed when the spell is cast.<br>
<B>At Higher tiers:</B> When you cast this spell using a higher-tier spell slot, the number of undead you can animate increases by 4 HD for each tier above 3rd.x<br>
<br>


<br>
Antimagic Field <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> 10 ft.<br>
<B>Targets:</B> 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.<br>
An <I>antimagic field</I> suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an <I>antimagic field</I> counts against the suppressed spell's duration.<br>
Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an <I>antimagic field</I>. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast <I>antimagic field</I> in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has Magic Resistance, you use your skill check roll to determine if that creature is affected by the antimagic field. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an <I>antimagic field</I> because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)<br>
A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. <I>Dispel magic</I> does not remove the field.<br>
Two or more <I>antimagic fields</I> sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as <I>force wall</I>, <I>prismatic sphere</I>, and <I>prismatic wall</I>, remain unaffected by <I>antimagic field</I> (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.<br>
Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.
<br><br>

Arcane Sight <br>
Divination<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Self<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute (D)<br>
This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a <I>detect magic</I> spell, but <I>arcane sight</I> does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.<br>
You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning tier or an item's magic strength. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell tier, or 15 + one-half item's level for nonspell effects.)<br>
If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, and the strength of the most powerful spell or supernatural ability the creature currently has available for use.<br>
<I>Arcane sight</I> can be made permanent with a <I>permanency</I> spell.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 7<br>
You automatically know which spells or magical effects are active upon any individual or object you see. It still doesn't let you identify magic items. Tier 7 <I>arcane sight</I> cannot be made permanent with a <I>permanency</I> spell.<br><br>

Augury<br>
Divination<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M(c), F(c)<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
An <I>augury</I> can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.<br>
The spell provides one of four results:<br>
&#149; Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).<br>
&#149; Woe (for bad results).<br>
&#149; Weal and woe (for both).<br>
&#149; Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).<br>
You have no way to know whether the result is accurate or if the spell failed.<br>
The augury looks only about half an hour into the future, so long-term consequences are not accounted for. Casting <I>augury</I> multiple times on the same topic gives the same result as the first casting.<br>
<I>Material Component:</I> Incense worth at least 25 gp.<br>
<I>Focus:</I> A set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp.<br>
<br>

Awaken<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 24 hours<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Animal or tree touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
You awaken a tree or animal to humanlike sentience. To succeed, your skill roll must be higher than the animal's current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened.<br>
The <I>awakened</I> animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it may serve you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.<br>
An <I>awakened</I> tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. It gains the ability to move limbs, roots, vines, and has senses similar to a human's.<br>
An <I>awakened</I> animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). It cannot serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.<br>
An <I>awakened</I> tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language you know for each point of Intelligence bonus it has (if any).<br>
<br>

Baleful Polymorph<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude negates, Will partial; see text<br>
As <I>polymorph</I>, except that you change the target into a Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD. If the new form would be immediately fatal, you attack the targets Fortitude with a -5 malus.<br>
If you succed, you must also attack will (using the same roll). If you succeed again the target loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and magical abilities, and adopts the Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma scores, and special abilities of the new form. It retains its core and ordinary skills.<br>
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being <I>polymorphed</I>. A creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.<br>
<br><br>

Barkskin<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Living creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<I>Barkskin</I> toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +1 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by +1 for each Tier above 2, up to a maximum of +5 at Tier 6.<br>
The enhancement bonus stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B><br>
Each Tier above 2 increases the enhancement bonus by +1, up to a maximum of +5 at Tier 6. Casting this spell with a slot above Tier 6 has no additional effect.<br><br>

Bear's Endurance<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (harmless)<br>
The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the usual benefits to hit points, Constitution checks, Fortitude defence, and so forth.<br>
Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's Constitution drops back to normal and are not lost first as temporary hit points are.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 6<br>
When cast at Tier 6, <I>bear's endurance</I> can affect up to 10 creatures simultaneously, each of which must be within range.<br><br>

Bestow Curse<br>
Necromancy<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
You place a curse on the subject. Choose one of the following effects:<br>
&#149; -6 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).<br>
&#149; -4 penalty on attack rolls, defences, ability checks, and skill checks.<br>
&#149; Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.<br>
You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.<br>
The <I>curse</I> bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with <I>break enchantment</I>, <I>remove curse</I>, <I>limited wish</I>, <I>wish</I>, or <I>miracle</I>.<br>
<I>Bestow Curse</I> counters <I>Remove Curse</I>.<br><br>

Break Enchantment<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> See text<br>
This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. <I>Break enchantment</I> can reverse even an instantaneous effect. You make a power check (1d20 + skill) and compare for each effect against a DC of 10 + twice the effect's level. Success means the creature is freed from the effect or curse. For cursed magic items, the DC is 25.<br>
If the effect comes from a spell that cannot be dispelled by <I>dispel magic</I>, <I>break enchantment</I> works only if that spell is Tier 5 or lower.<br>
If the effect is caused by a permanent magic item, <I>break enchantment</I> does not remove the curse from the item, but does free the creature from its effects.<br><br>

Bull's Strength<br>

A cone of searing flame shoots from your fingertips. Any creature in the area of the flames takes 1d4 points of fire damage.<br>
Flammable materials burn if the flames touch them. A character can extinguish burning items as a full-round action.<br>
<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 2, 3<br>
The damage increases by 2d4 at each higher tier.<br><br>

Cat's Grace<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (harmless)<br>
The transmuted creature becomes more graceful, agile, and coordinated. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, adding the usual benefits to AC, Reflex saves, and other uses of the Dexterity modifier.<br>
<br>

<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 10 creatures within 30 ft. of each other<br>

Chain Lightning<br>
Evocation [Electricity]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One primary target plus up to 10 secondary targets within 30 ft. of the primary target<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Reflex half<br>
This spell creates an electrical discharge beginning as a single strike from your fingertips. Unlike <I>lightning bolt</I>, <I>chain lightning</I> arcs from one initial target to multiple others.<br>
The primary target takes 6d6 electricity damage. Each secondary target takes half damage (3d6).<br>
Secondary targets must be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once.<br>

Charm<br>
Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One humanoid creature or animal<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
This charm makes a humanoid or animal regard you as a trusted friend and ally (treat attitude as friendly). If the target is threatened or attacked by you or allies, it gains +5 on its defence.<br>
The spell does not control the <I>charmed</I> creature like an automaton, but it views your words and actions favorably. You can issue orders, but must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything outside its normal behavior (no retries). It never obeys suicidal or clearly harmful orders but might accept risky ones. Any act by you or your allies that threatens the <I>charmed</I> creature breaks the spell. You must communicate in the creature's language or pantomime well.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Target:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> One day<br>
The effect ignores creature type or size.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Multiple creatures, no two more than 30 ft. apart<br>
<B>Duration:</B> One day<br>
It affects creatures whose combined Hit Dice do not exceed twice your tier, or at least one creature regardless of HD. If there are more potential targets than you can affect, choose them until the HD limit is exceeded.<br>
<br>
Cloudkill<br>
Conjuration (Creation)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude partial; see text<br>
This spell generates a bank of yellowish-green poisonous vapors. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD. To kill a living creature with 4 to 6 HD you need to succeed on a Fortitude attack. If you fail, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each turn while in the cloud.<br>
A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each turn while in the cloud if you succeed a Fortitude attack, or half of that otherwise. Holding one's breath doesn't help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected.<br>
The cloud moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.<br>
Each round, recalculate the cloud's spread based on its new origin point, 10 feet farther away from the original casting point.<br>
Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest land levels, pouring down openings such as dens or sinkholes. It cannot penetrate liquids and cannot be cast underwater.<br><br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 8<br>
When cast at Tier 8 or higher, the spell becomes <I>Incendiary Cloud</I>. The cloud is filled with white-hot embers instead of poisonous vapors. Each round, all creatures within the cloud take 4d6 points of fire damage (Reflex half). The cloud moves and behaves exactly as <I>Cloudkill</I> does, and wind disperses it as normal. By concentrating, you can direct the cloud up to 60 feet per round. Any portion beyond the spell's range dissipates harmlessly.

Color Spray<br>
Illusion (Pattern) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>

<B>Area:</B> Cone-shaped burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous; see text<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly knocking them unconscious.<br>
Each creature within the cone is affected according to its Hit Dice.<br>
<I>2 HD or less:</I> The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.)<br>
<I>3 or 4 HD:</I> The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round.<br>
<I>5 or more HD:</I> The creature is stunned for 1 round.<br>
Sightless creatures are not affected by <I>color spray</I>.<br>

<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.<br>
<I>Approach:</I> On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.<br>
<I>Drop:</I> On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.<br>
<I>Fall:</I> On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.<br>
<I>Flee:</I> On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.<br>
<I>Halt:</I> The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.<br>
If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.<br>
<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 5<br>

<B>Range:</B> Far<br>
<B>Area:</B> Cone-shaped burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Reflex half<br>
You unleash an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and extending outward in a cone. It drains heat from everything in its area, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).<br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> The spell deals an additional 2d6 cold damage for each tier above 5.<br>

<B>Target:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This spell causes a single creature to become <I>confused</I> for 1 round. While confused, the subject rolls on the following table at the beginning of its turn each round to determine its behavior:<br>
<table width="95%" border="1">
<tr>
<td><B>d%</B></td>
<td><B>Behavior</B></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>01-10</td>
<td>Attack the caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attack is not possible).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11-20</td>
<td>Act normally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>21-50</td>
<td>Do nothing but babble incoherently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>51-70</td>
<td>Flee away from caster at top possible speed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>71-100</td>
<td>Attack nearest creature (a familiar counts as part of the subject).</td>
</tr>
</table>
A confused character who cannot perform the indicated action does nothing but babble. Attackers do not gain special advantage, and any attacked confused creature automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn if still confused.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier: 4</B><br>
<B>Targets:</B> All creatures in a 15-ft. radius burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round<br>
The spell affects multiple creatures as above, applying the same confusion table to each affected target.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier: 7</B><br>
<B>Target:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
The subject suffers a continuous <I>confusion</I> effect indefinitely. Only <I>greater restoration</I>, <I>heal</I>, <I>limited wish</I>, <I>miracle</I>, or <I>wish</I> can remove the effect. <I>Remove curse</I> does not affect this spell. <br><br>

Control Undead<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
This spell enables you to command undead creatures for a short period of time. You command them by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible, the controlled undead do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior.<br>
Intelligent undead creatures remember that you controlled them.<br><br>

Control Weather<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> 2 miles<br>
<B>Area:</B> 2-mile-radius circle centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 4d12 hours<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in.<br>

<table width="95%" border="1">
<tr><td><B>Season</B></td><td><B>Possible Weather</B></td></tr>
<tr><td>Spring</td><td>Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather</td></tr>
<tr><td>Summer</td><td>Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm</td></tr>
<tr><td>Autumn</td><td>Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet</td></tr>
<tr><td>Winter</td><td>Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw</td></tr>
<tr><td>Late winter</td><td>Hurricane-force winds or early spring (coastal area)</td></tr>
</table>

You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather—where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use an action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.<br>
Control Weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.<br>
<br>

Control Winds<br>
Transmutation [Air]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Area:</B> Cylinder with radius and height up to 400 meters<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude negates<br>
You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an “eye” of calm air up to 25 meters in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area smaller than your full limit.<br>

<B>Wind Direction:</B><br>
You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell's area:<br>
&#149; A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions.<br>
&#149; An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center, veering upward before impinging on the eye.<br>
&#149; A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion.<br>
&#149; A blast causes the winds to blow in one direction across the area.<br>

<B>Wind Strength:</B><br>
For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level. Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effects of the wind.<br><br>

Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.<br>
Severe winds (31+ mph) cause minor ship and building damage.<br>
Windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships.<br>
Hurricane-force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder.<br>
Tornado winds (175+ mph) destroy all nonfortified buildings and often uproot large trees.<br>
<br>

This spell allows you to create more powerful undead than basic animation. The type of undead you can create is based on the level at which you cast the spell, as shown in the table below.<br>

<table width="95%" border="1">

</table>

Created undead are not automatically under your control, though you may attempt to command them as they form if you are capable of doing so. The spell must be cast at night.<br>

<I>Material Component:</I> A clay pot filled with grave dirt, another with brackish water, and a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead, placed in the corpse's mouth or eye socket. The gem is consumed in the process.<br><br>

<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will half (harmless) for living targets; Will negates for undead<br>
You channel positive energy into a creature you touch, healing 1d8 hit points.<br>

Undead creatures take 1d8 points of damage per spell tier instead of healing. You must succeed a Will attack otherwise the target negates the effect.<br>

<B>At Higher Tiers:</B><br>
<ul>
  <li><B>Tier 2-4:</B> Heals an additional 1d8 per tier (max 4d8 at Tier 4). Still targets one creature.</li>

Darkness<br>
Evocation [Darkness]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Object touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>

You cause an object to radiate magical darkness in a 20-foot radius. The area is filled with shadowy illumination. All creatures within the area have concealment (20% miss chance). This concealment affects even creatures with darkvision or low-light vision.

Normal light sources and light spells of lower tier cannot brighten the area. <I>Darkness</I> counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower tier. If cast on a small object that is then covered with a lightproof material, the effect is blocked until uncovered.

<B>At Higher Tiers:</B><br>
<ul>
  <li><B>Tier 3:</B> The radius increases to 60 feet. Duration becomes 1 day. <I>Darkness</I> and <I>Daylight</I> of the same tier temporarily negate each other in overlapping areas.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

Darkvision<br>
Transmutation<br>

<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>

The target gains the ability to see in complete darkness as if it were dim light, up to a distance of 60 feet. This vision is black and white only but otherwise functions as normal sight.

<I>Darkvision</I> does not allow the target to see through magical darkness.
<br><br>

Daylight<br>
Evocation [Light]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Object touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>

The touched object radiates bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Creatures that suffer penalties in bright light are affected while within this area.

If <I>daylight</I> is cast on a small object and that object is enclosed in an opaque covering, the light is blocked until the covering is removed.

<I>Daylight</I> cancels or dispels magical darkness of equal or lower tier. If both effects are present in the same area, they are temporarily negated in the overlap.

Detect Magic<br>
Divination<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 0<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Far<br>
<B>Area:</B> Cone-shaped emanation<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration, up to 1 minute (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>

You sense magical auras within the area. The amount of information increases the longer you concentrate on a specific area or object:

<I>1st Round:</I> You detect the presence or absence of magic.<br>
<I>2nd Round:</I> You learn the number of auras and the strongest one's intensity.<br>
<I>3rd Round:</I> You learn the strength and location of each aura. If in line of sight, you may identify the magical school with a successful Arcana check (DC 15 + tier of spell, or 15 + half caster level for non-spell effects).

Aura strength depends on spell tier or item caster level (faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming). Magical areas or overlapping effects may obscure weaker auras.

<I>Lingering Auras:</I> Magic leaves behind residual traces even after the source fades or is destroyed. These show up as dim and persist based on the original aura's strength.

This spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or soil.
<br><br>

Detect Thoughts<br>
Divination [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>

<B>Area:</B> Cone-shaped emanation<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration, up to 1 minute (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates; see text<br>

You sense the surface thoughts of conscious minds in the area. The information revealed depends on how long you focus on the same zone or subject:

<I>1st Round:</I> You detect the presence or absence of thinking minds (Intelligence 1+).<br>
<I>2nd Round:</I> You learn the number of minds and their Intelligence scores. If any mind has an Intelligence of 26 or higher and it exceeds your own Intelligence by 10 or more, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.<br>
<I>3rd Round:</I> You can read the surface thoughts of any one mind in the area. A successful Will save prevents this, and you must cast the spell again to try again. Minds with low Intelligence (1-2) produce simple, instinctual thoughts.

The spell does not reveal the location of minds unless the creatures are visible. You may redirect the cone each round. The effect is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or soil.

Dimension Door<br>
Conjuration (Teleportation)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>

<B>Target:</B> You and touched objects or one willing creature (up to Large size)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None and Will negates (object)<br>

You instantly transport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range (up to 50 meters). You arrive exactly where you intend, either by visualizing the destination or stating direction. After teleporting, you cannot take any further actions until your next turn.

You may bring along objects up to your maximum load. You can also bring one willing creature up to Large size (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) who is in physical contact with you.

If you arrive in a space occupied by a solid object or creature, you and all transported creatures take 1d6 damage and are shunted to a random free space on a suitable surface within 30 meters of the intended location.

If no free space exists within 30 meters, you and companions take an additional 2d6 damage and are shunted within 300 meters.

If no free space exists within 300 meters, you and companions take an additional 4d6 damage and the spell fails.

<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 5 creatures within range<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes (D)<br>
You make yourself and/or the targeted creatures—including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment—look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change body types. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure minor features or look like entirely different people.<br>
The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of the subjects or their equipment.<br>
If you use this spell to create a disguise, you gain a +10 bonus on the Disguise check.<br>
A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier (5):</B><br>
<B>Range:</B> Close <br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 5 creatures, no two targets more than 30 ft. apart<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 12 hours (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Will negates or Will disbelief (if interacted with)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes or No; see text<br>
You can change the appearance of other people as well. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain.<br>
To affect unwilling targets you have to succeed a Will attack.<br><br>


Disjunction<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 9<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close <br>
<B>Area:</B> All magical effects and magic items within a 40-ft.-radius burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (object)<br>
All magical effects and magic items within range, except those you carry or touch, are unraveled. Spells and spell-like effects are dismantled into their base energies (as if affected by <I>dispel magic</I>), and if you surpass magic items's Will defence, they lose their enchantment, becoming mundane. An item held or worn uses either its own Will defence or its bearer's, whichever is higher.<br>
You have a 1% chance per skill rank of dispelling an <I>antimagic field</I>. If the field remains, items within it are unaffected.<br>
Artifacts are also subject to the effect, but only have a 1% chance per skill rank of being affected. If an artifact is destroyed, you must succeed on a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting ability — a loss no mortal magic, not even <I>miracle</I> or <I>wish</I>, can restore.<br>
<I>Note:</I> Destroying an artifact is perilous, as it is 95% likely to draw the wrath of a powerful being bound to or invested in its existence.<br><br>

<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>

<B>Target or Area:</B> One spellcaster, creature, or object; or 20-ft.-radius burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
You can use <I>dispel magic</I> to end ongoing spells cast on a creature or object, temporarily suppress magical abilities of magic items, end ongoing spells within an area, or counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration expired. Some effects cannot be dispelled.<br>
Note: Spells with instantaneous duration cannot be dispelled.<br>

You choose one mode when casting:<br>
<I>Targeted Dispel:</I> You target one object, creature, or spell and compare your skill roll (1d20 + your skill level, max +10) against each ongoing spell affecting the target. The DC for each dispel check is 10 + (2 * the spell's tier). Success dispels that spell.<br>
- If the target is a magic item, a successful check suppresses its magical properties for 1d4 rounds.<br>
- You automatically succeed against spells you cast.<br>

<I>Area Dispel:</I> You affect everything within a 20-foot radius burst. For each creature or object with ongoing spells, comppare the skill roll against the highest tier spell first, then weaker spells until one is dispelled or none is. Magic items are not affected. You can also attempt to dispel ongoing area or effect spells originating or overlapping within the burst.<br>

<I>Counterspell:</I> Target a spellcaster and attempt to counter a spell.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier (6):</B><br>
- The maximum bonus on dispel checks increases from +10 to +20. The malus to the skill roll is only applied for the purpose of using power pool, but you still use the full skill for this roll.<br>
- Additionally, you may attempt to dispel effects that <I>remove curse</I> can remove, even if normally unaffected by dispel magic.<br><br>

Dominate Person<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Target:</B> One humanoid<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 days<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Will negates<br>
You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind.<br>
If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as “Come here,” “Go there,” “Fight,” and “Stand still.” You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.<br>
Once you have given a <I>dominated</I> creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, an Intuition check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect.<br>
Changing your instructions or giving a <I>dominated</I> creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.<br>
By concentrating fully on the spell (an action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.<br>
Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out.<br>
Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.<br>
If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.<br>
<I>Protection from evil</I> or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it.<br>

<B>Spell Resistance:</B> —<br>
The target becomes more poised, articulate, and personally forceful. It gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma, improving Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. This does not grant bonus Power Points or spells known, but does increase the DC of abilities and spells cast while the bonus is active.<br>

A creature protected by <I>endure elements</I> suffers no harm from being in a hot or cold environment. It can exist comfortably in conditions between -45&nbsp;°C and 60&nbsp;°C without needing to make Fortitude checks. The creature's equipment is likewise protected.<br>
<I>Endure elements</I> does not provide protection from fire or cold damage, nor from other environmental hazards such as smoke, lack of air, and so forth.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
You release a black ray of crackling negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If the attack succeeds, the subject gains 1d4 Fading.<br>
If the subject has at least as many Fadings as Hit Dice, it dies. Each Fading gives a creature a -1 penalty on all skill scores. Fadings stack.<br>
Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your skill roll. Usually, Fadings have a chance of become a permanent Drain, but the Fadings from <I>Enervation</I> don't last long enough to do so.<br>
An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4x5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude negates<br>
The target instantly grows in size, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This changes its size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (minimum 1), and takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to increased size.<br>
A humanoid that becomes Large has a space of 3 meters and a natural reach of 3 meters. This spell does not alter speed.<br>
All worn and carried equipment enlarges accordingly. Melee and projectile weapons deal more damage due to their size. Items revert to normal size once they leave the creature's possession. Magical properties are not affected.<br>
If growth is constrained, the creature grows as much as possible and may make a Strength check (with the enhanced Strength bonus) to burst the enclosure. If it fails, it is simply trapped by the environment.<br>
Multiple magical effects that alter size do not stack.<br>
<I>Enlarge Person</I> counters and dispels <I>Reduce Person</I>.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 5 humanoid creatures, no two of which can be more than 10 meters apart<br>

Expeditious Retreat<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Targets:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute per caster level (D)<br>
This spell increases your base land speed by 9&nbsp;m. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance.<br>
<br>

Feather Fall<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 reaction<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One Medium or smaller free-falling object or creature within range<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Until landing or 1 round per skill roll<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object)<br>
The affected creature or object falls slowly. <I>Feather fall</I> instantly changes the rate at which the target falls to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subject takes no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.<br>
The spell affects one Medium or smaller creature (including gear and carried objects up to its maximum load) or object.
You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn't your turn.<br>
This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.<br>
<I>Feather fall</I> works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.<br>
<br>

Find the Path<br>
Divination<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 3 rounds<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal or Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> You or one creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes per skill roll<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None or Will negates (harmless)<br>
The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, whether it is outdoors, underground, or even inside a <I>maze</I> effect. <I>Find the Path</I> works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The destination must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.<br>
The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the subject may sense the presence of a trip wire, or know the proper word to bypass a <I>glyph of warding</I>.<br>
The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. <I>Find the Path</I> can also be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a <I>maze</I> in a single round.<br>
This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and it does not predict or account for the actions of creatures (including guardians).<br>
<br>

Fire Shield<br>
Evocation [Fire or Cold]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Reflex<br>
This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice).<br>
Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage. The caster rolls against the target's Reflex Defence: if successful, the attacker takes full damage; otherwise, the attacker takes half damage. This damage is either cold damage (if the <I>shield</I> protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the <I>shield</I> protects against cold-based attacks). Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.<br>
When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color)&#151;blue or green if the <I>chill shield</I> is cast, violet or blue if the <I>warm shield</I> is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.<br>
<I>Warm Shield:</I> The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks.<br>
<I>Chill Shield:</I> The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks.

Fireball<br>
Evocation [Fire]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Area:</B> 20-ft.-radius spread<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Reflex<br>
A <I>fireball</I> is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 5d6 points of fire damage to every creature within the area. The caster rolls against each target's Reflex Defence: on a success, the target takes full damage; otherwise, it takes half. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.<br>
You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the <I>fireball</I> is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and blossoms into the <I>fireball</I> at that point, unless it impacts a material body or solid barrier before reaching its destination, in which case it detonates prematurely.<br>
The <I>fireball</I> sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the <I>fireball</I> may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.<br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B><br>
Each Tier above 3 increases the damage by +2d6.<br>
<B>Tier 7 and upwards:</B> The fireball may also detonate up to 5 rounds after being cast. You may choose for the glowing bead to detonate immediately, or delay the burst for as many as 5 rounds. The delay is chosen when you cast the spell and cannot be changed. If someone touches the bead before detonation, there is a 25% chance it explodes immediately. The bead can be picked up and hurled as a thrown weapon (range increment 10 feet).<br>

Flesh to Stone<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Far<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude<br>
The caster rolls against the target's Fortitude Defence. On a success, the subject, along with all its carried gear, turns into a mindless, inert statue of stone. The creature is not dead, but it is no longer alive when examined with magic. Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.<br>
If the statue created by this effect is broken or damaged, and the creature is later restored to flesh, it retains the same injuries or deformities.<br>
<br>

Fly<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
The target gains a fly speed of 18 meters (12 meters if wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load). It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, with good maneuverability. The subject can attack or cast spells normally while flying. The target can charge but not run, and cannot carry more weight than its maximum load plus its armor.<br>
If the spell ends while the target is still aloft, it floats gently down 18 meters per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground safely in that time, no damage is taken; otherwise it falls the remaining distance, taking damage as normal.<br>
<BR>
<B>At Higher Tier (Tier 5):</B><br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> Self<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour<br>
You gain a fly speed of 12 meters (9 meters if wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load) with average maneuverability. For long-distance travel, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (though forced marches still require Constitution checks). Overland flight allows you to cover about 100 km in an eight-hour period (or about 75 km at a reduced speed).<br>
<br>

Forcecage<br>
Evocation [Force]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M, F<br>

<B>Range:</B> Very Close (6 m)<br>
<B>Area:</B> Barred cage (6 m cube) or windowless cell (3 m cube)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 24 hours<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
You conjure an immobile, invisible cubical prison made of pure force, either with bars or solid walls (your choice).<br>
- <I>Barred Cage:</I> Creates a 6 m cube formed of force bars half a finger thick with equally wide gaps. Small creatures or those able to squeeze through tight spaces may escape; others remain trapped. Weapons small enough to pass through the gaps can be used against creatures inside, but they gain cover against such attacks. Spells and breath weapons pass freely through the bars.<br>
- <I>Windowless Cell:</I> Creates a 3 m cube with solid walls of force on all sides, completely sealing those within.<br>
Teleportation and similar effects can bypass the cage, but ethereal travel is blocked. The structure cannot be dispelled, but may be destroyed by <I>disintegrate</I>, a <I>sphere of annihilation</I>, or similar effects.<br>
<I>Material Component:</I> A pinch of ruby dust worth 1,500 gold coins, consumed in the casting.<br>
<br>

Foresight<br>

<B>Range:</B> Personal or Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> You or a creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
This spell grants a powerful sixth sense regarding impending danger. The subject of <I>foresight</I> is never surprised or caught unprepared, and cannot be flat-footed. In addition, if you are the subject, you gain a +2 insight bonus to Defence against attacks.<br>
When another creature is the subject, you receive the warnings instead and must communicate them in order for that creature to benefit. The subject does not gain the insight bonus to Defence in this case, but you can alert them in time to avoid harm if you act immediately (whether by calling out, pulling them aside, or telepathically warning them).<br>
<br>

Fox's Cunning<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>

<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (harmless)<br>
The affected creature becomes sharper and more cunning. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, which improves Intelligence-based skill checks and the save DCs of spells cast while under this effect. This spell does not grant additional skill points.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 6<br>
When cast at Tier 6, <I>fox's cunning</I> can affect up to 10 creatures simultaneously, each of which must be within range.<br><br>

Freedom of Movement<br>

<B>Range:</B> Personal or Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> You or creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (harmless)<br>
This spell allows the subject to move and act normally regardless of conditions that would otherwise hinder or restrain them. While under the effect, the subject automatically succeeds on any roll made to resist or escape grapples, paralysis, or magical effects that impede movement (such as <I>web</I>, <I>slow</I>, or <I>solid fog</I>).<br>
The subject can also move and attack normally underwater, even with slashing or bludgeoning weapons, as long as they are wielded in hand. This spell does not grant the ability to breathe water.<br><br>

Gaseous Form<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Willing corporeal creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) no longer protects it, though size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and force-based armor still apply. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic and becomes immune to poison and critical hits. It cannot attack or cast spells that require verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form, and it loses access to supernatural abilities. Any touch spell prepared is harmlessly discharged when the <I>gaseous form</I> takes effect.<br>
A gaseous creature cannot run but can fly at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. It can seep through cracks, small holes, or narrow gaps, carrying what it wears or holds, as long as the effect lasts. The form is subject to the effects of wind, cannot enter water or other liquids, and cannot manipulate objects or activate items. Passive or continuously active items remain functional, though some may be rendered ineffective by the form.<br><br>

Gate<br>
Conjuration (Creation or Calling)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 9<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F, M (see text)<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Effect:</B> See text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous or concentration (up to 1 minute)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
Casting a <I>gate</I> spell has two distinct functions: planar travel and calling creatures.<br><br>

<I>Planar Travel:</I> You create an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and another plane you specify, allowing travel between them in either direction. The <I>gate</I> appears as a circular portal, 5 to 20 feet in diameter (your choice), oriented as you decide. It looks like a window into the chosen plane, and any creature stepping through is transported instantly to the other side. The <I>gate</I> has a front and a back: only creatures moving through the front are transported. You may hold the <I>gate</I> open for up to 1 minute with concentration. A <I>gate</I> cannot open to another point on the same plane; it only works for interplanar travel. Deities and rulers of planar realms can prevent gates from forming in their presence if they wish.<br><br>

<I>Calling Creatures:</I> Instead of planar travel, you may open a <I>gate</I> to call an extraplanar creature to your location. By naming a specific being or type of creature as you cast the spell, the <I>gate</I> pulls the target through—willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings cannot be compelled to come, though they may choose to. This form of <I>gate</I> only remains open long enough for the creatures to arrive.<br><br>
- You may call either one creature of any power, or several creatures, provided their combined strength does not exceed your skill roll result.  
- If calling a single creature, you can control it only if its HD is not more than twice your roll.  
- A creature stronger than that, or a deity/unique being, cannot be controlled and acts freely. Such beings may leave at will—or remain as they please, making this use potentially dangerous.<br><br>

Controlled creatures can be commanded to perform either:  
- **Immediate tasks** (a single battle, or actions completed within 1 minute). No payment is required, and the creature departs when the task ends.  
- **Contractual services** (more involved duties). In this case, you must offer fair payment, goods, or favors in exchange. If the agreement is broken, the creature or its masters may exact retribution.  

<I>Material Component:</I> Rare incense and offerings worth 10,000 gp (only when using the calling function).<br><br>

Geas<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One living creature with 7 Hit Dice or fewer<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Until discharged (D) or up to a number of days equal to your skill roll<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
You place a magical command on a creature to follow a specific course of action, perform a service, or refrain from an activity. The creature must be able to understand your instructions. While a <I>geas</I> cannot compel a creature to kill itself or take actions that would certainly result in death, nearly any other task is possible.<br><br>

The compelled creature must follow the given instructions until the <I>geas</I> is fulfilled, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve an open-ended task that cannot be completed directly, the <I>geas</I> lasts for up to 1 day per caster level. If the subject is prevented from obeying for 24 hours, it suffers a -2 penalty to all ability scores. Each additional day adds another -2 penalty, up to -8. No score can be reduced below 1. The penalties fade 24 hours after the subject resumes following the <I>geas</I>.<br><br>

A <I>geas</I> cannot be dispelled but may be ended by <I>remove curse</I>, <I>limited wish</I>, <I>miracle</I>, or <I>wish</I>.<br><br>

<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 6<br>
When cast at Tier 6, <I>geas</I> can affect a creature of any Hit Dice, and the spell lasts a number of days equal to the skill roll. The subject does not receive a Defence roll. If the subject is prevented from obeying the <I>geas</I> for 24 hours, it suffers a -3 penalty to all ability scores. Each day of continued disobedience adds another -3 penalty, to a maximum of -12. No ability score can be reduced below 1. The penalties fade 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the <I>geas</I>.<br><br>

A <I>remove curse</I> spell ends a Tier 6 <I>geas</I> only if its caster level is at least two higher than that of the original caster. <I>Break enchantment</I> does not end it, but <I>limited wish</I>, <I>miracle</I>, and <I>wish</I> do.<br><br>

Ghost Sound<br>
Illusion (Figment)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 0<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Illusory sounds<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will disbelief (if interacted with)<br>
You create illusory sounds that can rise, recede, approach, or remain in place. You decide the type of sound when you cast the spell and cannot change it afterwards.  

The volume of sound is limited to the equivalent of up to four humans. For example, you could mimic marching soldiers, a roaring beast, or the squealing of a rat swarm, provided the total noise fits within this limit.  

<I>Ghost Sound</I> can enhance the believability of other illusion spells, such as <I>Silent Image</I>. It may also be made permanent with <I>Permanency</I>.<br>
<br>

Ghoul Touch<br>
Necromancy<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>

<B>Range:</B> Reach<br>
<B>Target:</B> One living humanoid<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1d6+2 rounds<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude negates<br>
Your touch channels necrotic energy, paralyzing one living humanoid for the spell's duration on a successful melee touch attack.  

While paralyzed, the target emits a foul carrion stench. All living creatures within 10 feet (except you) must succeed on a Fortitude save or become sickened for as long as they remain in the area.  

The stench effect can be removed with <I>Neutralize Poison</I>. Creatures immune to poison are unaffected.<br><br>

Glitterdust<br>
Conjuration (Creation)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>

<B>Area:</B> 10-foot-radius spread<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 3 rounds<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (blinding only)<br>
A cloud of sparkling golden dust fills the area, clinging to creatures and objects.  
- All creatures in the area must attempt a Will roll or be blinded for the spell's duration.  
- The dust outlines invisible creatures and objects, making them visible.  
- Affected creatures take a -40 penalty on Stealth checks.  
The glittering dust cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until the spell ends.<br><br>

Globe of Invulnerability<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>

<B>Area:</B> 10-ft.-radius spherical emanation, centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
A faintly shimmering, immobile magical sphere surrounds you and blocks all spells of Tier 3 or lower from affecting creatures or objects within the globe.  
- Any spell effect of Tier 3 or lower is suppressed while inside the globe.  
- Spell-like abilities and item-based effects of that Tier are also blocked.  
- Spells of Tier 4 and higher are unaffected, as are spells already in effect when the globe is cast.  
Spells can still be cast through or out of the globe, but their effects cannot enter if they are of too low a Tier.  

<B>At Higher Tiers:</B><br>
- <B>Tier 6:</B> The globe also blocks spells and effects of Tier 4 or lower.<br>
- <B>Tier 8:</B> The globe also blocks spells and effects of Tier 5 or lower.<br><br>

Grease<br>
Conjuration (Creation)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Close (6 m)<br>
<B>Target or Area:</B> One object or a 3 m x 3 m (10-ft.) square<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Reflex negates; see text<br>
This spell covers a solid surface or object with slippery grease.  

- **On a surface:** Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must succeed on a Reflex defence or fall prone. The save is repeated each round the creature remains in the area. A creature can move through the area at half speed with a DC 10 Balance check; on failure, it cannot move that round and must attempt a Reflex defence or fall. Failure by 5 or more on the Balance check causes it to fall automatically.  

- **On an object:** Unattended objects are automatically affected. A held or used item requires its wielder to succeed on a Reflex defence or immediately drop it. Each time the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item, it must repeat the Reflex defence.  

- **On armor or clothing:** A greased creature's armor or clothing grants a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or a pin.  <br><br>

Gust of Wind<br>
Evocation [Air]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Far (18 m)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Line-shaped gust of severe wind (about 80 km/h / 50 mph) emanating from you to the limit of range<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude negates<br>
This spell creates a powerful blast of wind that pushes through the area, affecting all creatures and objects in its path.  

- **Tiny or smaller creatures:**  
  - On the ground: knocked down and rolled 1d4 x 3 m, taking 1d4 nonlethal damage per 3 m.  
  - Flying: blown back 2d6 x 3 m, taking 2d6 nonlethal damage.  

- **Small creatures:** knocked prone, or if flying are blown back 1d6 x 3 m.  

- **Medium creatures:** cannot move forward against the gust, or if flying are blown back 1d6 x 1.5 m.  

- **Large or larger creatures:** may move normally within the area.  

Any creature, regardless of size, suffers a x4 penalty on ranged attacks and on sound-based Perception checks while within the gust.  

The force automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames, while protected flames (such as lanterns) have a 50% chance of being extinguished. The gust can stir dust and sand into a blinding spray, fan fires, overturn fragile structures, heel over small boats, and disperse vapors and gases to the edge of its range.  <br><br>

<B>Defence:</B> Will half<br>
You channel raw negative energy into a creature, dealing 100 hit points of damage. On a successful save, the target takes half damage. This spell cannot reduce a living creature below 1 hit point.  
If cast on an undead creature, this spell instead restores hit points as if it were <I>Heal</I>. <br><br>

<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You afflict the target with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into manic laughter, falling prone and unable to take actions, though it is not considered helpless.  

A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is unaffected. A creature whose type differs from yours gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw, as humor does not translate well across different kinds of beings.  <br><br>

<B>Duration:</B> 3 rounds (D); see text<br>
<B>Defence: </B>Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. (This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.)  

A winged creature who is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1d4+1 rounds (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures, causing them to stop and stare blankly at you. In addition, you can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible.  
You affect creatures whose combined Hit Dice do not exceed 2d4. Creatures with fewer Hit Dice are affected before those with more. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, though they need not understand you.  
If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its Will defence. If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a -2 penalty.  
While the subject is fascinated by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude. This allows you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particular request.  
A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it.<br><br>

<B>Target:</B> You or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lb.<br>  
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute (D)<br>  
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object)<br>  
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless) or Yes (harmless, object)<br>  
The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. Gear carried by a creature also becomes invisible. Dropped items become visible; picked-up items disappear again if stored on the recipient. Light sources never become invisible. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature (spells that harm enemies or include them in the area count as attacks). Actions directed at unattended objects or indirect harm do not break the spell.<br>  
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 3<br> 
The invisibility extends in a 10-ft.-radius around the recipient, affecting all creatures in the area, who can see each other and themselves. Moving out of the area ends invisibility, while moving in after the casting has no effect. Attacking ends invisibility only for the attacker. 
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 4<br> 
The invisibility no longer ends when the subject attacks. 
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 7<br> 
The spell targets any number of creatures, no two more than 180 ft. apart. The effect moves with the group, but individuals cannot see each other. If anyone attacks, they lose invisibility, and moving beyond 180 ft. from the nearest group member ends the effect for that individual (or both, if only two are affected and they separate).<br><br>

You surround yourself with a sphere of magical energy that negates all forms of invisibility. Anything invisible within the sphere becomes visible while inside. The radius of the sphere is 5 feet per tier of the spell (Tier 3 = 15 ft.).<br>  
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 4<br>
The radius increases to 20 ft.
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 5<br>
The radius increases to 25 ft.
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 7<br>
The radius increases to 35 ft.<br><br>  

Iron Body  <br>

<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>  
<B>Target:</B> You<br>  
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute (D)<br>  
This spell transforms your body into living iron, granting you several powerful resistances and abilities. You gain damage reduction 15/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems.<br>  
You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but take a -6 penalty to Dexterity (minimum 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean at least until the spell duration expires.<br><br>

<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous; see text<br>  
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>  
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>  
The <I>knock</I> spell opens stuck, barred, locked, <I>held</I>, or <I>arcane locked</I> doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains, provided they serve to hold closures shut. If used to open an <I>arcane locked</I> door, the spell does not remove the <I>arcane lock</I> but temporarily suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. <I>Knock</I> cannot raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, or similar obstacles. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing egress.<br><br>  

Legend Lore  <br>

<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>  
<B>Target:</B> You<br>  
<B>Duration:</B> See text<br>  
You call ancient knowledge and forgotten tales into your mind about an important person, place, or object. If the subject is at hand, or you are within the location in question, the casting requires only 1d4x10 minutes. If you possess only detailed information, the casting requires 1d10 days and produces knowledge that is incomplete. If you know only rumors, the casting requires 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague. During the casting, you may engage only in routine activities such as eating or sleeping. When complete, the spell reveals legends if any exist, whether still known, long forgotten, or never before revealed. If the subject is not of legendary importance, no knowledge is gained.<br>  
<I>Material Component:</I> Incense worth at least 250 gp.<br>  
<I>Focus:</I> Four strips of ivory worth 50 gp each, arranged into a rectangle.<br>  
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 7<br>
The casting requires only a single action. You may pose a question about a person, place, or object, and the spell answers with a vision. If the subject is at hand or you are within the location, the vision is clear. If you possess only detailed information, the vision is incomplete, while if you know only rumors, the vision is vague. 
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 8<br>
The spell always provides a vision in response to your question, regardless of how little is known beforehand. The vision is always clear, though the tales that surface may still be shaped by legend and myth.<br><br>

<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>  
This spell causes an object to glow like a torch, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for an additional 20 feet) from the point you touch. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical <I>darkness</I> does not function.<br>  
A light spell (one with the light descriptor) counters and dispels a darkness spell (one with the darkness descriptor) of an equal or lower tier.<br><br>

<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>  
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Reflex half<br>  
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>  
You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 5d6 points of electricity damage to each creature within its area. The <I>lightning bolt</I> sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.<br>  
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B><br>
Each Tier above 3 increases the damage by +2d6.<br><br>

<B>Duration:</B> See text<br>  
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None; see text<br>  
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>  
You invoke a powerful alteration of reality, capable of reshaping events and duplicating the effects of lesser spells. A <I>limited wish</I> can reproduce most magical effects within its scope, allowing you to:<br>  
- Duplicate any spell of Tier 6 or lower, provided it is not from a tradition you cannot access.<br>  
- Duplicate any spell of Tier 5 or lower, even if from a restricted or forbidden tradition.<br>  
- Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as <I>geas</I> or <I>insanity</I>.<br>  
- Produce any other magical effect comparable in power, such as granting a creature an automatic success on its next attack or imposing a -7 penalty on its next saving throw.<br>  
Spells duplicated through <I>limited wish</I> allow saving throws and resistance as normal. If the duplicated spell requires a costly material component worth more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component. <br>  
<I>Material Component:</I> A diamond worth at least 1,500 gp.<br><br>

Locate<br>

<B>Area:</B> Circle, centered on you, with a radius of 500 ft.<br>  
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute (D)<br>  
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>  
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>  
You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. You can search for general items, in which case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a specific item requires an accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination). The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell. <I>Polymorph</I> effects can fool it.<br>  
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 4<br>  
The spell instead locates a known or familiar creature. You slowly turn and sense when you are facing the direction of the creature, provided it is within range. You also know the direction in which the creature is moving, if any. The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific individual known to you, but not a general type or category. To locate a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once. Running water blocks the spell, and it cannot detect objects. It may be fooled by <I>mislead</I>, <I>nondetection</I>, or <I>polymorph</I> effects.<br><br>

An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the target, granting a +4 armor bonus to Defense. Unlike physical armor, <I>mage armor</I> imposes no penalties and does not reduce movement. Because it is formed of pure force, incorporeal creatures cannot bypass it.<br><br>

A dart of magical force shoots from your fingertips and strikes a target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage. The dart hits unerringly, even if the target is in melee, has partial cover, or is partially concealed. Inanimate objects are not affected by this spell. For every two tiers beyond 1st you gain an additional missile: two darts at Tier 3, three darts at Tier 5, four darts at Tier 7, and five darts at Tier 9. If you fire multiple darts you may have them strike a single creature or several creatures; a single dart can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before applying Defence or rolling damage.<br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 3<br>
You create two darts. You may direct them at a single creature or at separate targets within range. Each dart can strike only one creature.<br>

<I>Magic weapon</I> imbues a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. This enhancement does not stack with a masterwork weapon's inherent +1 bonus on attack rolls.<br>

Beyond the threshold lies a grand foyer and numerous furnished chambers of your design, up to the spell's volume limit. The air is fresh and comfortable, and the mansion is provisioned with fine food sufficient for a twelve-course feast for a dozen guests per caster level. 24 Ethereal servants tend to guests and perform tasks as <I>unseen servants</I>, though visible and free to roam the mansion.<br>
The mansion is sealed from the outside world: external conditions do not affect it, and none within can influence the world beyond its door.<br>
<I>Focus:</I> A miniature ivory portal, a polished marble chip, and a tiny silver spoon (each worth 5 gp).<br><br>

<I>Message</I> allows you to whisper messages and receive whispered replies with minimal risk of being overheard. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the message is audible only to the targeted creature within range. Magical <I>silence</I>, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message can travel around barriers as long as there is an open path within range. Targeted creatures can whisper a reply you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning, and does not bypass language barriers.<br>
<I>Note:</I> You must mouth the words and whisper to send a message, which may allow observers to read your lips.<br><br>


Meteor Swarm<br>
Evocation [Fire]<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None or Reflex half, as indicated<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
<I>Meteor Swarm</I> is an extremely powerful spell similar to <I>fireball</I>. Four 2-foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to your chosen locations, leaving fiery trails of sparks. You may make a ranged touch attack to hit a specific creature. Any creature struck by a sphere takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage with no saving throw and is subject to fire damage as described below. If a targeted sphere misses, it explodes at the nearest corner of the target's space. Multiple meteors can target the same creature.<br>
When a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 fire damage to each creature in the area. Creatures affected by more than one sphere must save separately against each. Fire resistance applies individually to each sphere's damage.<br>

You create a nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving, vegetable matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 8 cubic feet. You must succeed on an appropriate skill check to create a complex item.<br>
Attempting to use any created object as a material component causes the spell to fail.<br>

Miracle<br>
Evocation<br>

<B>Components:</B> V, S, M; see text<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> See text<br>
<B>Targets:</B> See text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> See text<br>
<B>Defence:</B> See text<br>
You do not so much cast a <I>miracle</I> as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and ask that your deity—or the power you pray to for spells—intercede on your behalf.<br>
A <I>miracle</I> can do any of the following things:<br>
- Duplicate any other spell of Tier 8 or lower.<br>
- Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as <I>feeblemind</I> or <I>insanity</I>.<br>
- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.<br>
If the <I>miracle</I> has any of the above effects, casting it requires a material component.<br>
Alternatively, you can make a very powerful request. Casting such a <I>miracle</I> costs 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful <I>miracles</I> include:<br>
- Swinging the tide of battle by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.<br>
- Transporting you and your allies, with all your gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific location with no chance of error.<br>
- Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.<br>
- A request that is out of line with the deity's nature—or alignment—is refused.<br>
- A duplicated spell allows saving throws and resistances as normal. When a <I>miracle</I> duplicates a spell that has a material cost greater than 100 gp, you must pay that cost.<br>
<I>Material Component:</I> 25,000 gp in powdered diamond (for some uses of the <I>miracle</I> spell; see above).<br><br>


Mirror Image<br>
Illusion (Figment)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Targets:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
Several illusory duplicates of you appear, making it difficult for enemies to tell which target is real. The illusions remain close to you and vanish when struck.<br>
<I>Mirror Image</I> creates 1d4 duplicates. These figments cluster near you, each within 5 feet of another figment or of yourself. You can move through your images freely, and when you separate, observers cannot tell by sight or sound which one is real. The figments mimic all your actions, such as casting spells, drinking potions, or levitating.<br>
Enemies attempting to attack you or target you with spells must choose randomly among the indistinguishable figures. A successful attack destroys one image. Each image has an AC equal to your size modifier + your Dexterity modifier. Figments appear to react normally to area effects—such as seeming burned or destroyed by a <I>fireball</I>.<br>
While moving, you can merge with and split from your images, making it difficult for enemies who have identified the real you to maintain that knowledge.<br>
An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or your attacker cannot see, the spell has no effect (as blindness prevents visual deception).<br><br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 3-6<br>
You create 1 more image for each tier above 2nd, to a maximum of 4 more images at tier 6.<br><br>


Modify Memory<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 round (see text)<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close <br>
<B>Targets:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
You reach into the target's mind and alter up to 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways:<br>
&#149; Erase all memory of an event the target actually experienced. This spell cannot undo magical compulsions such as <I>charm</I>, <I>suggestion</I>, or <I>geas</I>.<br>
&#149; Cause the target to recall an actual event with perfect clarity.<br>
&#149; Change the details of an event the target experienced.<br>
&#149; Implant a false memory of an event that never occurred.<br>
Casting the spell takes 1 round. If you surpass the Will defence, you then spend up to 5 minutes concentrating—one minute for each minute of memory altered—visualizing the memory you wish to implant or modify. If your concentration is broken or the target moves out of range before you finish, the spell fails.<br>
A modified memory may not necessarily alter the target's behavior, especially if it conflicts with its natural tendencies. Implanted memories that are illogical or inconsistent are often dismissed as dreams or confused recollections.<br><br>

Moment of Prescience<br>
Divination<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Targets:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 12 hours<br>
You gain a powerful sense of foresight and awareness of your own fate. Once during the spell's duration, you can invoke this prescient insight to gain an <I>insight bonus</I> equal to 20 on a single attack roll, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you may apply the bonus to your AC against one attack (even if you are flat-footed).<br>
Activating the effect requires no action and may be done even outside your turn, but you must decide to use <I>moment of prescience</I> before making the roll it will modify. Once the effect is used, the spell ends.<br><br>


Nondetection<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>

<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Creature or object touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (harmless, object)<br>
The target becomes shielded from divination magic, making it difficult to locate or observe through spells such as <I>clairvoyance</I>, <I>locate object</I>, and <I>detect</I> effects, as well as scrying tools like <I>crystal balls</I>. When a divination targets the warded creature or item, the caster's skill roll must be higher than the <I>nondetection</I> skill roll to gain information.<br>
If the spell is cast on a creature, the protection extends to that creature's possessions.<br>
<I>Material Component:</I> A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 gp.<br><br>


Obscuring Mist<br>

<B>Effect:</B> Cloud spreads in a 20-ft. radius from you, 20 ft. high<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
A thick mist rises around you, remaining stationary once formed. The vapor blocks vision beyond 5 feet—creatures within 5 feet have concealment (20% miss chance), while those farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and cannot be seen).<br>
Moderate wind (around 11 mph) disperses the mist in 4 rounds; strong wind (21 mph or more) in 1 round. Fire effects such as <I>fireball</I>, <I>flame strike</I>, or a <I>fire wall</I> burn away the mist in their area of effect.<br>
This spell has no effect underwater.<br><br>

<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (object)<br>
You manipulate a nearby object to open or close as you choose. This can affect doors, chests, boxes, windows, bags, bottles, barrels, or similar containers. If the object is locked, barred, or otherwise secured, the spell fails. The object must weigh no more than 30 pounds, and massive doors or containers sized for huge creatures are beyond the spell's power.<br><br>

<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 6<br>

When cast at Tier 6, <I>owl's wisdom</I> can affect up to 10 creatures simultaneously, each of which must be within range.<br><br>

Passwall<br>

<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Creates a 5 ft. by 8 ft. opening, 30 ft. deep<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 8 hours<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
You open a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or harder materials. The tunnel is 30 feet deep. If the wall is thicker than the tunnel's depth, the spell forms only a niche or partial tunnel. Multiple <I>passwall</I> spells can be cast in sequence to penetrate very thick barriers.<br>
When the spell ends, any creatures still inside are harmlessly ejected through the nearest exit. If <I>passwall</I> is dispelled or dismissed, creatures within are pushed out through the far exit (or the only exit, if there is just one).<br>

Phantasmal Killer<br>
Illusion (Phantasm) [Fear, Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Far <br>
<B>Targets:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will disbelief (if interacted with), then Fortitude partial; see text<br>
You conjure an illusory manifestation of the target's deepest fears, shaping its subconscious terror into a visible phantasmal form. Only the target perceives the killer clearly—you see only a faint outline. You first attempt an attack against Will defence to disbelieve the illusion. If you succeed, the phantasm strikes, and you must succeed an attack against Fortitude to make the target die of fright. If you fail the attack against Fortitude the effect is reduced to 3d6 psychic damage.<br>
If the target successfully disbelieves the illusion while wearing a <I>helm of telepathy</I>, the phantasm may turn on you instead. You must then disbelieve it or face its deadly assault yourself.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 9<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Any number of creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
The spell can target multiple creatures. Each perceives a unique phantasmal horror born of its own fears, visible only to itself. You perceive them merely as shadowy figures. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage to 3d6 and leaves the creature stunned for 1 round; it also takes 1d4 temporary Strength damage.<br><br>

Planar Binding<br>
Conjuration (Calling) [see text]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One elemental or outsider with up to 6 Hit Dice<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will<br>
You attempt the dangerous act of summoning and binding a creature from another plane within a specially prepared trap. The called being is held there until it agrees to perform one service in exchange for its freedom.<br>
To create the trap, you must first prepare a <I>magic circle</I> focused inward. The type of creature to be bound must be clearly defined, and if you wish to summon a specific individual, you must use its true name.<br>
The spell makes an attack against the target's Will. If successful, the creature is drawn into the trap and held; otherwise, it resists the calling. Once trapped, the creature can attempt to escape once per day—either by breaking the circle through sheer willpower, through planar travel, or by succeeding on a Charisma check (DC 15 + your Charisma modifier). A <I>dimensional anchor</I> effect prevents escape by planar means, and a properly prepared calling diagram can reinforce the trap.<br>
While trapped, you may bargain with the creature to secure a service. Make an opposed Charisma check, modified by +0 to +6 depending on the offer's fairness or reward. If you lose the contest, the creature refuses. You may retry once per day with a new proposal. Rolling a natural 1 on this check causes the binding to fail immediately, releasing the creature. If freed, it may flee—or retaliate.<br>
Once the agreed service is completed, the creature is released and instantly returns to its home plane, though it may later seek revenge. If the task is impossible or open-ended, the binding weakens after several days, granting the creature another chance to break free. Cunning entities often exploit ambiguous orders to twist their meaning.<br>
When used to summon creatures with elemental or moral aspects (air, earth, fire, water, chaotic, lawful, good, or evil), the spell gains the corresponding descriptor.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier (6):</B> You may summon a single creature with up to 12 Hit Dice, or up to three creatures of the same type whose combined Hit Dice do not exceed 12. Each resists, attempts escape, and negotiates separately.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier (8):</B> You may summon a single creature with up to 18 Hit Dice, or up to three creatures of the same type whose combined Hit Dice do not exceed 18. Each resists, attempts escape, and negotiates separately.<br><br>

<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> You and up to eight willing creatures holding hands<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will<br>
You and your companions instantly travel to another plane of existence or dimension. If up to eight willing creatures link hands, all can travel together through the same passage.<br>
The spell's precision is limited—you arrive 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended location on the target plane. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane in existence, though exact navigation between them requires familiarity or powerful planar knowledge.<br>
<I>Plane Shift</I> ends immediately after transportation; returning requires another casting or similar planar magic.<br>
<I>Focus:</I> A small, forked metal rod attuned to the destination plane, its composition and resonance determining which realm the spell accesses.<br>

<B>Target:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous; see text<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude<br>
You channel the venomous essence of nature's deadliest predators, delivering a toxic touch that seeps into your target's body. On a successful melee touch attack, the victim suffers 1d10 points of Constitution damage immediately and another 1d10 points one minute later. Each instance of damage is reduced or negated if you fail an attack against Fortitude.<br><br>


Polymorph<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>

<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Self<br>
<B>Targets:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes (D)<br>
You transform your body into that of another creature of your same type. The new form must be within one size category of your normal size. The maximum complexity (or Hit Dice equivalent) of an assumed form is equal to your skill score in this spell, to a maximum of 5.<br>
You retain your own mental abilities and all supernatural or magical traits that do not rely on a specific body part your new form lacks (such as eyes for a gaze or a mouth for a breath weapon). You gain the new form's physical attributes—size, movement types (up to 18 m flight or 12 m ground), natural armor, and natural weapons. You do not gain extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities of the new form.<br>
Your type and subtype remain unchanged. You may alter minor physical traits such as coloration, height, or gender within the limits of the chosen species, gaining a +10 bonus to Deception checks made to disguise yourself as a typical member of that form.<br>
Your equipment merges into your new form if it cannot be worn or held. When the spell ends, items reappear as before, and any equipment incompatible with your natural form falls at your feet.<br>
<br>
<B>At Higher Tier (4):</B><br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One willing creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute (D)<br>
You transform a willing creature into another living form. The target may assume a form of its own type or any of the following: aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, ooze, plant, or vermin. The assumed form cannot exceed the lower of your skill rating or the target's natural power (up to an equivalent of 15 Hit Dice).<br>
The target retains its mental scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) but adopts the new form's physical scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution). It gains the new form's extraordinary attacks but not its special qualities or supernatural powers. If slain while polymorphed, it reverts to its natural body. Shapechangers can revert to their true form as an action.<br>
<br>
<B>At Higher Tier (8):</B><br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature or nonmagical object (up to 3 cubic meters of material per skill rank)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> See text<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude (object)<br>
You transform one creature or object into another. The duration depends on how extreme the transformation is. Similar or related changes last longer, while drastic changes are brief. Typical durations are:<br>
<ul>
<li>Minor or related change (twig to branch, clay to brick): 3-12 hours</li>
<li>Dissimilar change (stone to flesh, person to statue): 20 minutes-2 days</li>
<li>Radical or inverse change (creature to inanimate, or vice versa): up to permanent</li>
</ul>
This spell cannot create intrinsically valuable materials (such as gold or gems) or replicate magical effects or properties (e.g., cold iron's special traits). Magical items are unaffected.<br>
This spell can duplicate effects such as <I>flesh to stone</I>, <I>stone to flesh</I>, or <I>transmute rock to mud</I>.<br>
<br>
<B>At Higher Tier (9):</B><br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Range:</B> Self<br>
<B>Targets:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes (D)<br>
You may assume the form of any single nonunique creature (of any type) from Fine to Colossal size. The new form cannot exceed twice your skill score in power. You gain all extraordinary and supernatural abilities of the form but lose your own supernatural traits. You also gain its type and subtype. You may change your form once per round as a free action, before or after your main action.<br>
If you use this spell to disguise yourself, you gain a +10 bonus on Deception checks. Equipment merges into your new form and reappears unchanged when you revert.<br>
<I>Focus:</I> A jade circlet worn upon casting (worth at least 1,500 gp), which merges with your new form.<br><br>

<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
You speak a word of absolute power that ends life instantly. The chosen creature dies outright if its current hit points are 100 or fewer, regardless of whether it can hear the word. Creatures with more than 100 hit points are unaffected.<br>

Prestidigitation allows you to perform small, harmless magical effects for up to one hour. You can lift up to 1 pound of material, clean or soil an object up to 1 foot in size each round, or chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving matter. These effects are cosmetic and cannot cause harm or disrupt concentration. You can create simple, fragile objects that appear crude and lack any real function—they cannot serve as tools, weapons, or spell components. Any minor alteration beyond simple cleaning or coloring lasts only one hour.<br><br>


Protection from Energy<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes or until discharged<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
This spell grants temporary immunity to a specific type of energy chosen when casting (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). The ward absorbs damage up to 12 points per skill rank, with a maximum of 120 points. Once the absorbed damage exceeds this limit, the spell is discharged.  

If combined with <I>resist energy</I>, the effects overlap but do not stack: <I>protection from energy</I> absorbs damage first until its power is exhausted.<br><br>


Protection<br>
Abjuration [Aligned: Good, Evil, Lawful, or Chaotic]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (harmless)<br>
This spell wards a creature against attacks and influence from creatures of a chosen moral or ethical alignment (Good, Evil, Lawful, or Chaotic). A shimmering barrier forms around the target, extending about one foot and moving with them. 
The protection has three primary effects:  <br>
1. <I>Deflection and Resistance:</I>
   The target gains a +2 bonus to Defense and a +2 bonus to all saving throws against effects or attacks made by creatures of the opposed alignment.  <br>
2. <I>Mental Protection:</I>
   The barrier blocks any attempt to possess or mentally control the target, including effects such as <I>magic jar</I> or <I>dominate</I>. These effects can still target the creature, but their influence is suppressed for the duration of the protection. If the protection ends before the mental control effect does, control resumes. This protection applies regardless of alignment.  <br>
3. <I>Ward Against Summoned Beings:</I>  
   Summoned creatures of the chosen opposed alignment cannot touch or attack the warded creature with natural weapons. Such creatures recoil if they attempt contact. This effect ends if the warded creature attacks or attempts to push against the barrier.  <br>
Creatures with sufficient magical strength may still overcome this ward and touch the protected target.<br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F, M (optional)<br>
<B>Area:</B> 10-meter-radius emanation from touched creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes (D)<br>
All creatures within the area gain the effects of the <I>protection</I> spell. Summoned creatures whose alignment opposes the chosen one cannot enter the area. Overcoming their magical resistance allows them to cross the barrier, but the bonuses to Defense, saving throws, and mental protection still apply.  
This spell can also be <I>focused inward</I> to bind a called or summoned creature of the opposed alignment. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundary for up to 24 hours. The circle must be drawn with powdered silver before casting. If the circle is broken, the effect immediately ends.  
The circle does not prevent teleportation or planar travel unless reinforced with a <I>dimensional anchor</I> cast before the creature acts.  
A properly drawn <I>magical diagram</I> (crafted with a Spellcraft check, typically requiring 10 minutes) strengthens the circle, preventing extradimensional escape and increasing the difficulty for the creature to break free. Disturbing the diagram, even slightly, ends the effect.    <br><br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1d4+1 rounds (see text)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will or Fortitude negates (see text)<br>

You transform an existing fire into either a burst of dazzling fireworks or a billowing cloud of choking smoke. You choose the version when casting the spell.  <br>

<I>Fireworks:</I> A blinding explosion of glowing, colored lights erupts from the fire source. Creatures within 36 meters (120 feet) who can see the fire must defend against the effect or become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. This is an attack against Will. Magical resistance can prevent this effect.  <br>

<I>Smoke Cloud:</I> Thick smoke bursts from the fire source, spreading 6 meters (20 feet) in all directions and lasting for 1 minute. Vision, including darkvision, is completely blocked within or through the cloud. You attack all creatures inside against Fortitude, and if you are successful they suffer a -4 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. These penalties persist for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the smoke. Magical resistance does not apply.  <br>

<I>Material Component:</I> A natural fire source, which is immediately extinguished. Fires larger than a 6-meter cube are only partially extinguished. Magical fires are unaffected, though a fire-based creature used as the source takes 1 point of damage per tier of the caster.<br><br>

<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> One dead creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None (harmless)<br>

You restore life to a deceased creature that has been dead for no longer than a few days. The creature's soul must be free and willing to return; unwilling souls cannot be revived.  <br>

Returning from death takes a toll on the body and spirit. The creature permanently loses 1 Hit Die. If it only had 1 Hit Die, it instead suffers a -2 penalty to Constitution (if this would reduce Constitution to 0 or less, the spell fails). These losses cannot be restored by any means.  <br>

The creature returns with hit points equal to its Hit Dice and is cured of nonmagical diseases and poisons, though magical afflictions and curses remain. The body must be mostly intact; missing parts are not restored. The spell has no effect on constructs, undead, outsiders, elementals, or those who died of old age.  <br>

<I>Material Component:</I> Diamonds worth at least 5,000 gold pieces.<br>

<B>At Higher Tiers:</B>7<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
You restore life and vitality to a deceased creature even if the body is damaged or incomplete. As long as a fragment of the body remains, the creature can be revived. The target may have been dead for up to several decades.  <br>

The creature returns to full health and strength, though it still loses 1 Hit Die (or 2 Constitution if it had only 1 Hit Die). These penalties are permanent.  <br>

You can restore creatures destroyed by death effects or those who became undead and were later destroyed. This spell still cannot affect constructs, outsiders, elementals, or those who died of old age.  <br>

<I>Material Component:</I> A sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 10,000 gold pieces.<br>

<B>At Higher Tiers:</B>9<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
You can restore a creature to life no matter how long it has been dead, so long as the soul is free and identifiable (naming or describing the deceased suffices). The body is fully restored, even if it no longer exists.  <br>

The creature returns to life at full health with no penalties or conditions, as though it had never died.  <br>

This spell can also restore elementals and outsiders but not constructs or undead. It cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.  <br>

<I>Material Component:</I> A sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gold pieces.<br><br>

A ray of dark energy springs from your hand. Make a ranged attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target suffers a penalty to Strength equal to <I>1d6</I> . The target's Strength score cannot drop below 1.

<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude partial<br>

A black ray shoots from your pointing finger. Make a ranged attack against a creature within range. Also make an attack against the target's Fortitude defence. On a hit, the target becomes <I>exhausted</I> for the duration. If you fail the Fortitude attack, the target is instead <I>fatigued</I>. <br> 

A creature that is already fatigued becomes exhausted instead, and a creature that is already exhausted is unaffected.  <br>
Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, this effect ends immediately when the spell's duration expires.<br><br>

<B>Target:</B> One humanoid creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Fortitude negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>

This spell causes a humanoid creature to shrink to half its height, length, and width, reducing its weight to one-eighth of normal. The target's size category decreases by one. It gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a -2 size penalty to Strength (minimum 1), and a +1 bonus to attack rolls and Armor Class due to its smaller size.<br>

A Small creature reduced to Tiny has a space of 2.5 feet and a reach of 0 feet (it must enter an enemy's square to attack). A Large creature reduced to Medium has a 5-foot space and 5-foot reach. The target's movement speed is unchanged.<br>

All worn and carried equipment is reduced proportionally. Melee and ranged weapon damage decreases according to size, though other magical properties remain unaffected. Any reduced object leaving the target's possession instantly returns to normal size. Thrown weapons therefore deal normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the weapon that launched them.<br>

Multiple size-reducing effects do not stack. <I>Reduce</I> counters and dispels <I>Enlarge</I>.<br>

<B>Saving Throw:</B> Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
<I>Remove Curse</I> instantly lifts all curses affecting a creature or object. The spell does not directly remove a curse from a cursed weapon, shield, or armor, but it does allow the affected creature to safely remove or discard the cursed item. Some particularly powerful or unique curses may require a higher-tier caster or special conditions to break.<br>
<I>Remove Curse</I> counters and dispels <I>Bestow Curse</I>.<br><br>

<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>

This abjuration grants a creature limited protection against one of five energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sound. The target gains resistance 10 against the chosen energy type, reducing damage from that source by 10 points each time it takes such damage. This protection improves to 20 points at higher tiers, and to 30 points at even greater mastery. The effect also protects the target's equipment.<br>

<I>Resist Energy</I> only mitigates damage; secondary effects such as paralysis, slowing, or burning still apply.<br>
<I>Note:</I> <I>Resist Energy</I> overlaps (but does not stack) with <I>Protection from Energy</I>. If both are active, <I>Protection from Energy</I> absorbs damage first until its protection is depleted.<br><br>

<I>Restoration</I> removes any magical effects reducing one of the target's ability scores or heals 1d4 points of temporary ability damage to a single ability score. It also eliminates fatigue, paralysis, diseases, blindness, deafness and improves an exhausted condition to fatigued. It does not restore permanent ability drain.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
This version also removes Fadingss and restores one Drain, provided the loss occurred within 7 days. <I>Restoration</I> cures all temporary ability damage and restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if multiple are affected). It eliminates fatigue and exhaustion. It does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due ato death.<br>

You completely purge afflictions from the target. All Fadingss are dispelled, and any Drains are restored if the loss occurred within 3 months. The spell removes all magical penalties to abilities, cures all temporary ability damage, and restores all points permanently drained from all ability scores. It also eliminates fatigue, exhaustion, insanity, confusion, and similar mental effects. It does not restore levels or Constitution points lost through death.<br>

Rope Trick<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 2 hours<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>

When you touch a rope between 5 and 30 feet in length, one end rises into the air and becomes fixed as if anchored to an invisible point. The upper end connects to a small extradimensional space, hidden beyond ordinary reality.  

Up to eight creatures can enter and remain within this space, regardless of size. Those inside are completely hidden and cannot be detected or affected by spells, including divinations, unless those spells can cross planar boundaries.  

Creatures within can pull the rope into the space, making it vanish from sight. If they do so, the rope itself counts as one of the eight occupants. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds before detaching.  

No spell or area effect can cross the boundary of the extradimensional space. Those inside can see the outside world through a small, invisible window (about 3 feet by 5 feet) centered on the rope's location. Anything within the space falls out when the spell ends. Only one creature can climb the rope at a time.  

<I>Note:</I> Creating an extradimensional space within another such space—or bringing one inside another—is extremely dangerous and may cause catastrophic collapse or planar rupture.<br>

<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>

You create an invisible magical sensor that allows you to see and hear a creature at any distance, even across planes. You attack the Will defence of the target, and if you fail the scrying attempt fails. Your roll is modified by how well you know the creature and what kind of physical connection you possess. If the creature is on another plane, it gains a +5 bonus on its Will defence.<br>

</table>

If the spell is successful, you can see and hear the target and its immediate surroundings (about 10 feet in all directions). The sensor follows the subject, moving up to 150 feet per round. You perceive through the sensor using your normal and magical senses.<br>

If the attempt fails, you cannot try to scry on that creature again for 24 hours.<br>

<I>Focus:</I> A mirror of polished silver worth at least 1,000 gp, a holy water font worth at least 100 gp, or a natural pool of still water.<br>

You send a brief telepathic message of up to twenty-five words to a creature you know personally. The target instantly receives the message and can respond in kind with a message of equal length. The target recognizes you as the sender if it is familiar with you.<br>

Creatures of any Intelligence can understand the message if they know a language, though their response may be limited by intellect or comprehension.<br>

If the target is on a different plane, the message has a 5% chance of failing to reach it, and certain planar effects or magical interference may increase this chance.<br><br>

You emit a powerful, resonating tone that disrupts brittle materials or crystalline structures.<br>

When used as an area effect, <I>Shatter</I> destroys all nonmagical objects made of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain within a 5-foot radius. Objects heavier than 10 kg are unaffected, but lighter ones are shattered instantly.<br>

Alternatively, you can target a single solid, nonmagical object weighing up to 10 kg, causing it to crack or break apart. When aimed at a crystalline creature, <I>Shatter</I> instead deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. The target may roll Fortitude to resist half damage.<br>

<B>At Higher Tiers:</B>3-5<br> 
You can shatter larger objects. The maximum affected weight increases by 10 kg per tier, and the sonic damage increases by 2d6 per tier, up to a maximum of tier 5.<br><br>

You summon an invisible disk of pure force that hovers before you like a shield, moving to intercept attacks. The shield grants a +4 bonus to Defence and blocks incoming projectiles of pure energy, such as those created by <I>magic missile</I>. <br>

Because the shield is a force effect, its bonus applies even against incorporeal attacks. However, unlike a physical tower shield, it cannot be used to provide cover.<br>

You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 5d6 points of sonic damage if you succeed a Fortitude attack againts them. A failure negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 7d6 points of sonic damage. You make an attack against Fortitude against cristalline creatures, and if you fail reduce the damage by half. You make the attack against Reflex against creatures holding fragile objects, and if you succed the damage is negated.<br>
A <I>shout</I> spell cannot penetrate a <I>silence</I> effect.<br>
<br>
<B>At Higher Levels:</B><br>
At tier 8, the cone extends to 60 ft. Creatures in the area take 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 15d6 points of sonic damage, against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. Failure of the attack against Fortitude means that the stunning, deafness are negated and damage is halved. Failure of the attack against reflexes against a creature holding vulnerable objects means the damage is negated.<br>


Shrink Item<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> One touched object of up to 10 cu. ft.<br>
<B>Duration:</B> One day; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Will negates (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (object)<br>
You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object's size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now-shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a <I>shrink item</I> spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.<br><br>


Silence<br>
Illusion (Glamer)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Area:</B> 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object, or point in space<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Will negates; see text or none (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes; see text or no (object)<br>
Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. You have to succed an attack against Will agaonst an unwilling creature for the spell to work, and spell resistance applies, if any. The same applies to items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound, but not to unattended objects and points in space. This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks.<br><br>


Silent Image<br>
Illusion (Figment)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Visual figment that cannot extend beyond four 10-ft. cubes (S)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will disbelief (if interacted with)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by you. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration +2 rounds<br>
The spell includes some minor sounds but not understandable speech.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration +3 rounds<br>
The spell effect includes sound, smell, and thermal illusions. While concentrating, you can move the image within the range. The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless you cause the illusion to react appropriately.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes (D)<br>
The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components, and follows a script determined by you. The figment follows that script without your having to concentrate. The illusion can include intelligible speech.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F, M<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Figment that cannot extend beyond a 150-ft. cube (S)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent (D)<br>
The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements. By concentrating, you can move the image within the limits of the range, but it is static while you are not concentrating.<br>
<I>Material Component:</I> A bit of fleece plus powdered jade worth 100 gp.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Visual figment that cannot extend beyond a 150-ft. cube (S)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent until triggered, then 10 rounds<br>
The figment activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech. You set the triggering condition (which may be a special word) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or specific as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be based on qualities not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment.<br>
<I>Material Component:</I> A bit of fleece and jade dust worth 25 gp.<br><br>


Simulacrum<br>
Illusion (Shadow)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 12 hours<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One duplicate creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
<I>Simulacrum</I> creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The duplicate is partially real, formed from ice or snow. It appears identical to the original, but has only one-half of the original creature's levels or Hit Dice, including the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or HD. You cannot create a simulacrum of a creature whose Hit Dice or levels exceed twice your caster level. A Disguise check is required when casting to determine the quality of the likeness. A creature familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful Spot check (opposed by the caster's Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check.<br>
At all times, the simulacrum remains under your absolute command. No special telepathic link exists; command must be exercised by normal means. A simulacrum cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly. Repairing a damaged simulacrum requires at least 24 hours, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped magical laboratory.<br>
<I>Material Component:</I> The spell is cast over the snow or ice form, and a piece of the creature to be duplicated (hair, nail, or the like) must be placed inside. Additionally, powdered ruby worth 100 gp per HD of the simulacrum is required.<br>
<I>Material Component:</I> 500 gp in diamond dust per HD of the simulacrum (minimum 5,000 gp).<br><br>


Sleep<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Area:</B> One or more living creatures within a 10-ft.-radius burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
<I>Sleep</I> causes a magical slumber to come upon up to 4 Hit Dice worth of creatures. Creatures with the fewest Hit Dice are affected first. Among creatures with equal Hit Dice, those closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Any remaining Hit Dice not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.<br>
Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding an affected creature awakens it, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature requires an action (an application of the aid another action).<br>
<I>Sleep</I> does not affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead.<br>
<B>At Higher Levels:</B>3<br> 
You can affect additional creatures. The spell affects up to 10 Hit Dice of creatures.<br><br>


Sleet Storm<br>
Conjuration (Creation) [Cold]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Area:</B> Cylinder (40-ft. radius, 20 ft. high)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 5 rounds<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
A driving storm of sleet fills the area, blocking all sight (even darkvision) and coating the ground in slippery ice. A creature can move through the area at half its normal speed by succeeding on a DC 10 Acrobatics check. On a failed check, it cannot move that round; if it fails by 5 or more, it falls prone.<br>
The sleet also extinguishes torches and small open flames.<br><br>


Slow<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 5 creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 5 rounds<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
Each affected creature moves and acts at a drastically reduced pace. A <I>slowed</I> creature can either move or take an action. It also takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, Defence, and Reflex, and its speed is halved (round down to the next 5-ft. increment). This reduction also limits jumping distance as normal for reduced speed.<br>
Multiple <I>slow</I> effects do not stack. <I>Slow</I> counters and dispels <I>haste</I>.<br><br>


Speak with Animals<br>
Divination<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
You can understand and communicate with ordinary animals. This spell allows simple conversation: you may ask questions and receive answers, though it does not make the animals friendlier or more intelligent than they naturally are. Wary creatures may be evasive, while simple-minded ones may speak in brief or nonsensical ways. A friendly or trained animal might agree to assist or perform a small service at your request.<br><br>


Speak with Dead<br>
Necromancy [Language-Dependent]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One dead creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 5 minutes<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
You grant a semblance of life and memory to a corpse, allowing it to answer your questions. You may ask 5 questions. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what it knew in life, including any languages it once spoke. Its answers are brief and may be cryptic or repetitive.<br>
You cannot use this spell on a corpse that has been questioned in the past week. The body must be mostly intact and able to speak — at least possessing a mouth. A damaged corpse may provide only partial or unclear answers.<br>
This spell does not call back the soul of the deceased. It instead reanimates the lingering imprint of its memories and personality. The corpse cannot learn or recall anything beyond what it knew in life, nor can it remember previous questionings.<br>
This spell has no effect on undead creatures.<br><br>


Spell Resistance<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
The creature gains spell resistance equal to 12 + your skill roll.<br>
<br>


Spell Turning<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Until expended or 2 hours<br>
This spell creates a shimmering ward that reflects hostile magic back at its source. Only spells or effects that specifically target you are affected — area effects and touch spells are not turned.<br>
The ward can reflect between seven and ten levels of magic (1d6 + 4 determined randomly by the GM). When a spell targets you, the corresponding number of levels is subtracted from your remaining reflection capacity. If a spell's level exceeds the ward's remaining power, it is only partially reflected: divide the remaining reflection power by the incoming spell's level to determine what fraction of the effect rebounds. The rest affects you normally.<br>
If both you and the attacking caster are protected by spell turning, the interaction creates a resonating field. Roll to determine the outcome:<br>

Spider Climb<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 30 minutes<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will resists (harmless)<br>
You grant the target the ability to move along walls and ceilings like a spider. The affected creature gains a climb speed of 6 meters and does not need to make Climb checks to move across vertical or inverted surfaces. The creature retains its normal defences while climbing, and attackers gain no special advantage. However, it moves at half its speed while climbing.<br>


Stabilize<br>
Conjuration (Healing)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 0<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One dying creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None (harmless)<br>
You touch or channel energy toward a dying creature, halting its decline. The target immediately stabilizes and no longer loses Hit Points from bleeding or dying. If it later takes damage, it resumes dying as normal.<br><br>


Stoneskin<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (harmless)<br>
The target's skin hardens to the strength of stone, granting it damage reduction 10/adamantine. The creature ignores the first 10 points of weapon damage from each hit, unless the attack is made with an adamantine weapon. The spell ends once it has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150).<br>
<I>Material Component:</I> A pinch of granite dust and diamond dust worth 250 gold pieces, sprinkled on the target's skin.<br><br>


Stone to Flesh<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far <br>
<B>Target:</B> One petrified creature or a cylinder of stone 1-3 ft. in diameter and up to 10 ft. long<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude negates (object); see text<br>
You restore a petrified creature to its natural form, returning life and possessions. You make an attack against the target's Fortitude with a +5 bonus. If you succeed, you automatically slay the creature. Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored.<br>
You can also transform a section of stone into flesh. This flesh is inert and lifeless unless infused with life energy. For instance, a stone golem turned by this spell becomes a flesh golem, while a statue simply becomes a corpse. You may affect a cylindrical section of stone up to 3 ft. wide and 10 ft. long, or the equivalent portion of a larger stone mass.<br><br>


Suggestion<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour or until completed<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will (attack)<br>
You influence the actions of the target by proposing a specific course of activity expressed in one or two short sentences. To impose the suggestion you make an attack against the target's Will. The suggestion must be worded so that it sounds reasonable to the target; a direction that clearly orders the target to do something obviously harmful to itself causes the spell to fail automatically.<br>
The suggested activity can continue for the full duration; if the task can be completed sooner, the spell ends when the subject finishes it. Instead of immediate action, you may set a trigger condition that causes the subject to perform the suggested action later during the spell's duration. The spell conveys intent and phrasing only — it does not grant new abilities or force actions beyond the subject's capabilities or intrinsic nature.<br>
A particularly reasonable suggestion imposes a -2 penalty to the target's Defence against the attack to establish the suggestion.<br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 6<br>
The spell's Range increases to Far and it can affect multiple targets: one creature per tier, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart. The same suggestion applies to all targeted creatures; you make a separate attack against each target's Will to impose the suggestion.<br><br>


Summon Monster<br>
Conjuration (Summoning) [see text]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One summoned creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> A number of rounds equal to your skill roll (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
You call an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). The creature appears where you designate and acts immediately on your turn, behaving as you direct if you can communicate with it. A summoned creature cannot summon or conjure other creatures, nor use teleportation or planar-travel abilities, and it can't be summoned into an environment that cannot support it.<br>
You choose which creature to summon from the 1st-tier summon table when you cast the spell; you may change that choice each time you cast it.<br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> 2-9<br>
You may summon more or different creatures as the tier increases. At a higher tier you may either summon one creature from the list corresponding to that tier, or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the list one tier lower, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the list two tiers lower. No two summoned creatures may be more than 30 ft. apart.<br>

You summon a natural creature. It appears where you designate and acts immediately on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.<br>
A summoned creature cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.<br>
The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying Summon Nature's Ally table. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All creatures on the table are neutral unless otherwise noted.<br>
<B>At Higher Levels:</B> 2-9<br>
You can summon one creature from the list at the level of the spell, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from one level lower, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a still lower-level list.<br>

Telekinesis<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Targets:</B> See text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration (up to a number of rounds equal to the skill roll) or Instantaneous; see text<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (object) or None; see text<br>
You move objects or creatures by sheer force of will. Depending on your focus, this spell can maintain a steady manipulation, perform combat maneuvers, or unleash a sudden burst of telekinetic power.<br>
<I>Sustained Force:</I> You can move an object weighing up to 250 pounds at a rate of 20 feet per round. A creature can negate this effect on an item it holds with a successful Will save. The spell requires concentration and ends if you stop maintaining it. You can manipulate the object as if using one hand—pulling levers, turning keys, or even untying simple knots, though fine work may require an Intelligence check.<br>
<I>Combat Maneuver:</I> Once per round, you can use telekinesis to attempt a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these as normal combat maneuvers, but they do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Spell resistance applies, and the spell ends if concentration ceases.<br>
<I>Violent Thrust:</I> You can expend the spell's energy in one powerful motion, hurling up to one object or creature per skill roll, all within 10 feet of each other, toward targets within 90 feet. You can throw up to a total of 250 pounds. Make an attack roll for each thrown object or creature. Weapons deal normal damage; other objects deal 1 point per 25 pounds for soft items or 1d6 per 25 pounds for hard, dense ones. If you try to hurl creatures you need to make an attack against their Will, and if thrown against a solid surface, they take damage as if falling 10 feet (1d6 points).<br><br>


Teleport<br>
Conjuration (Teleportation)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal and Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> You and touched objects or other willing creatures<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None and Will negates (object)<br>
You instantly transport yourself to a designated location within 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects up to your maximum load and one willing Medium or smaller creature (or its equivalent) per three caster levels. Larger creatures count as multiples: Large as two Medium, Huge as two Large, etc. All participants must be in contact, and at least one must touch you.<br>
You must have a clear mental image of the destination; the clearer your familiarity, the safer the arrival. Roll d% and consult the table below to determine the result.<br>
<I>Familiarity:</I> “Very familiar” means a place you know intimately. “Studied carefully” means a place you know well or have observed magically. “Seen casually” means you've seen it a few times. “Viewed once” means you've only seen it once. “False destination” is a nonexistent or radically changed location.<br>
<I>On Target:</I> You arrive exactly where intended.<br>
<I>Off Target:</I> You arrive a random distance and direction away (1d10x1d10% of total distance).<br>
<I>Similar Area:</I> You arrive in a visually or thematically similar area within range, or the spell fails if none exists.<br>
<I>Mishap:</I> You and all creatures transported take 1d10 damage and must reroll on the table with a +80 modifier; additional mishaps cause cumulative damage.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 7<br>
There is no range limit, and you always arrive on target. You may teleport to a place you have never seen if you have a reliable description. Attempting to teleport with false or insufficient information causes the spell to fail harmlessly. Interplanar travel remains impossible.<br>
<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 7<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> One object up to 50 lb. and 3 cu. ft. per caster level<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (object)<br>
You teleport an unattended or willing object to a chosen destination. Creatures and magical energies cannot be teleported. Optionally, you may send the object to the Ethereal Plane. The point of origin retains a faint magical trace; a <I>dispel magic</I> cast on that point returns the object.<br>

Time Stop<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 9<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1d4+1 rounds (apparent time); see text<br>
This spell makes time seem to stop for everyone but you. You move so quickly that all other creatures appear frozen, though they continue to exist and act at normal speed. You can take actions for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical effects such as fire, cold, or gas can still affect you.<br>
While <I>time stop</I> is active, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target them directly. Spells that affect areas and have durations longer than the remaining <I>time stop</I> take effect normally once the spell ends. Casters often use this time to summon allies, reposition, or enhance defenses.<br>
You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by creatures outside the effect, but you can interact with unattended objects.<br>
You are undetectable during <I>time stop</I> and cannot enter areas protected by an <I>antimagic field</I> while the spell lasts.<br><br>

<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
You grant the subject the ability to see things as they truly are. The subject can see through normal and magical darkness, detect secret doors hidden by magic, perceive exact locations of creatures or objects under <I>blur</I> or <I>displacement</I> effects, see invisible creatures or objects, recognize illusions, and discern the true form of polymorphed or transmuted creatures and objects. The subject can also focus to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces) within 120 feet.<br>
<I>True seeing</I> does not penetrate solid objects and does not confer X-ray vision. It does not bypass concealment caused by fog or other effects, nor does it reveal mundane disguises, hidden creatures, or secret doors hidden by nonmagical means. The spell cannot be augmented by other magic; for instance, it does not function through a <I>crystal ball</I> or combined with <I>clairaudience/clairvoyance</I>.<br>
<I>Material Component:</I> An ointment for the eyes costing 250 gp, made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat.<br><br>

Wall<br>
  Evocation/Conjuration [Fire, Cold]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Far<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Choose a wall type: Fire or Ice; Force or Stone if cast at Tier 5<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration + as many rounds as your skill roll<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Varies per effect; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This spell creates an elemental wall. Choose one wall type at casting:

<I>Fire Wall:</I> An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 4d6 points of fire damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.<br>
If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out. (Do not divide cold damage by 4, as normal for objects.)<br>
<I>fire wall </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell. A permanent <I>fire wall </I>that is extinguished by cold damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.<br>

<I>Ice Wall:</I> This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A <I>ice wall </I>cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. You make an attack against the Reflex of the creature to avoid that. A failure indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a <I>ice wall, </I>and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a <I>ice wall </I>creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.<br>
<I>Ice Plane: </I>A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 10 inches thick. It covers up to 10 areas of size 10-foot-square (so you can create a ice wall 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.<br>
Each 10-foot square of wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25.<br>
Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 3d6 points of cold damage (no save).<br>
<I>Hemisphere: </I>The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 10 feet. The <I>hemisphere </I>is as hard to break through as the <I>ice plane </I>form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.<br>

<B>At Higher Tiers:</B>5<br>
Evocation/Conjuration [Force, Earth]<br>
You can create one of the following additional wall types:<br>
<I>Force Wall:</I>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
 A <I>force wall </I>spell creates an invisible force wall. The wall cannot move, it is immune to damage of all kinds, and it is unaffected by most spells, including <I>dispel magic</I>. However, <I>disintegrate </I>immediately destroys it, as does a <I>rod of cancellation</I>, a <I>sphere of annihilation, </I>or a <I>disjunction </I>spell. Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through the wall in either direction, although <I>dimension door, teleport, </I>and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through a <I>force wall</I>.<br>
The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to 10 10-foot square per level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails.<br>

<I>Stone Wall:</I> 
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. A <I>stone wall </I>is 2.5 inches thick and composed of up to 10 5-foot squares. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.<br>
You can create a <I>stone wall </I>in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.<br>
Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a <I>disintegrate </I>spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.<br>
The caster determines orientation, shape, and composition at casting. Walls cannot occupy the same space as creatures or objects unless the wall's effect allows displacement.<br><br>


Water Breathing<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Living creatures touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 hours; see text<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (harmless)<br>
You grant the ability to breathe underwater to the touched creatures. The total duration is divided evenly among all affected targets. This spell does not remove the ability to breathe air.<br><br>


Water Walk<br>
Transmutation [Water]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 5 creatures<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (harmless)<br>
The affected creatures can walk upon the surface of any liquid as though it were solid ground. Mud, snow, oil, quicksand, running water, and even lava can be traversed easily, though extreme heat still inflicts damage from proximity. Subjects may move normally across such surfaces, including running or charging.<br>
If cast while the targets are submerged in liquid, they are carried upward at a speed of 60 feet per round until they reach the surface.<br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B>6<br>
Transmutation [Air]<br>
You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the <I>gaseous form </I>spell) and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.<br>
Normally, a <I>wind walker </I>flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a <I>wind walker </I>along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. <I>Wind walkers </I>are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.<br>
A <I>wind walker </I>can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.<br>
For the last minute of the spell's duration, a <I>wind walker </I>in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.<br><br>


Waves of Fatigue<br>

<B>Area:</B> Cone-shaped burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>

Waves of negative energy render all living creatures in the spell's area fatigued. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already fatigued.<br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B>7<br>
<B>Range:</B> 60 ft.<br>
Waves of negative energy cause all living creatures in the spell's area to become exhausted. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted.<br>
<br>


Web<br>
Conjuration (Creation)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Far <br>
<B>Effect:</B> Webs in a 6-meter-radius spread<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Reflex negates; see text<br>
You conjure a thick mass of sticky, fibrous strands that fill the area, forming strong, elastic webs that cling to everything nearby. The webs must be anchored to at least two solid and opposing points; otherwise, they collapse and vanish.<br>
You must succed on an attack on Reflex against Creatures caught within the area when the spell is cast. On a failure, they are <I>entangled</I> but can still move with difficulty. On a success, they are stuck in place, unable to move until they spend 1 round to attempt a DC 20 Strength check or DC 25 Agility check to break free. Once freed, a creature remains <I>entangled</I> but may move slowly, advancing 5 feet for every 5 points by which their check result exceeds 10.<br>
The webs provide <I>cover</I> if at least 5 feet thick and <I>total cover</I> if 20 feet thick.<br>
The webs are flammable: any source of fire burns away about 5 square feet per round. Creatures within burning webs take 2d4 fire damage each round.<br>
<br>


Whispering Wind<br>
Transmutation [Air]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> 3 miles <br>
<B>Area:</B> 3-meter-radius spread<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Up to 3 hours or until the message is delivered<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
You send a gentle, invisible current of air carrying a message or sound to a familiar location within range. The <I>whispering wind</I> travels unnoticed along any available path until it reaches its destination, where it softly delivers your message or chosen sound before dissipating.<br>
The message can contain up to twenty-five words or a brief sound lasting up to 1 round. You may also choose for the wind to carry only a faint stirring of air with no message at all. The <I>whispering wind</I> can move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as fast as 1 mile every 10 minutes.<br>
Once the wind reaches its destination, it lingers momentarily as it releases the message, then fades away. The spell cannot articulate magical words of power, command words, or other verbal components.<br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B>3-9<br>
The range increases by 2 miles for each tier above 2nd.<br><br>


Wish<br>

<B>Tier:</B> 9<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> See text<br>
<B>Target, Effect, or Area:</B> See text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> See text<br>
<B>Defence:</B> See text<br>
<I>Wish</I> is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By speaking a single word of power, you bend reality itself to your will.<br>
Even <I>wish</I>, however, has limits.<br>
A <I>wish</I> can produce any one of the following effects:<br>
&#149; Replicate any spell of Tier 8 or lower.<br>
&#149; Undo the harmful effects of many other spells or conditions, such as <I>geas</I> or <I>insanity</I>.<br>
&#149; Create a nonmagical item of extraordinary quality and value.<br>
&#149; Create or enhance a magic item, permanently adding or modifying its powers.<br>
&#149; Grant a creature a permanent +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five <I>wishes</I> cast in succession can grant a +2 to +5 inherent bonus (two wishes for +2, three for +3, and so on). An inherent bonus cannot exceed +5, and only the highest applies.<br>
&#149; Remove injuries or afflictions from one creature per caster level, provided they are of the same kind (for example, all wounds, or all poisons). A <I>wish</I> cannot restore drain lost through resurrection.<br>
&#149; Restore life to the dead, as with a <I>resurrection</I> spell. If the body is destroyed, two <I>wishes</I> are required—one to recreate the body and one to restore life. The subject still suffers any normal penalties associated with returning from death.<br>
&#149; Transport willing creatures across any distance or plane, regardless of barriers. You can move one creature per caster level. Unwilling creatures resist with an attack against Will.<br>
&#149; Undo recent misfortune by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round. Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result, which may be better or worse. An unwilling target resists with Will.<br>
You may attempt to use <I>wish</I> for greater effects than these, but doing so is perilous—the magic may twist your intent, producing only a partial or corrupted result.<br>
Replicated spells allow defences and resistances as usual, though the attack values are those of a Tier 9 spell.<br>
<I>Material Component:</I> A flawless diamond worth at least 25,000 gp. If the duplicated spell requires a component worth more than 10,000 gp, that component must also be provided. When creating or improving a magic item, the caster must also pay twice the normal cost.<br><br>


Zone of Truth<br>
Enchantment [Mind-Affecting, Compulsion]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close <br>
<B>Area:</B> 20-ft-radius emanation<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
<B>Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
Within the affected area, creatures are compelled to speak only the truth. You make an attack on Will against each creature entering or present in the area. If you succed, targets cannot deliberately lie but remain aware of the compulsion. They may still choose to remain silent, refuse to answer, or speak evasively, so long as they do not knowingly speak falsehoods.<br>
Creatures that leave the zone are immediately freed from the effect and may speak freely again.<br>
