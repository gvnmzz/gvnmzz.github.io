Acid Splash <br>
Conjuration (Creation) [Acid]<br>
<B>Tier: </B>0<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close <br>
<B>Effect:</B> One missile of acid<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> AC<br>
You fire a small orb of acid at the target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The orb deals 1d3 points of acid damage.<br>

Alarm <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Area:</B> 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 3 hours (dismissible)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<I>Alarm</I> creates a magical ward that detects intrusion. It triggers when a creature of Tiny or larger size enters or touches the area. You choose whether the <I>alarm</I> is audible or mental when casting. Creatures that speak a designated password (set during casting) do not trigger the <I>alarm</I>.<br>
<I>Mental Alarm:</I> Alerts only you, provided you're within 1 mile. The signal is a single mental ping that awakens you from sleep but does not otherwise disturb you. It functions even in a <I>silence</I> spell.<br>
<I>Audible Alarm:</I> Produces a clear ringing (like a hand bell) that lasts 1 round and is heard within 60 feet. Closed doors reduce this distance by 10 feet; walls reduce it by 20 feet. In quiet conditions, it may be faintly heard up to 180 feet away. The ringing is blocked by a <I>silence</I> spell.<br>
Ethereal and astral creatures do not trigger the <I>alarm</I>.<br>
This spell is cast through your focus, allowing you to ward an area without touching it.<br>
<I>Alarm</I> may be made permanent with a <I>permanency</I> spell.<br>
<b>Special:</b> This spell is not affected by Magic Resistance.<br><br>

Alter Self <br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Self<br>
<B>Targets:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form. The new form must be within one size category of your normal size. You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.<br>
You retain your own core skills. You retain all supernatural and spell-like skills of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).<br>
You keep all extraordinary skill, but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived fromt raining.<br>
If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.<br>
You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.<br>
You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.<br>
You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form. Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form. You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.<br>
You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.<br>
When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its true form.<br>

<B>Animate Dead</B><br>
Necromancy [Evil]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One or more corpses touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell animates corpses into skeletons or zombies that obey your spoken commands. You can direct them to follow you or to remain in a location and attack intruders. They remain animated until destroyed and cannot be reanimated again.<br>
You can animate up to <B>10 Hit Dice (HD)</B> worth of undead. You choose the mix of skeletons and zombies, but must meet the anatomical requirements (see below).<br>
Although the undead are permanent, you can only control a number of undead whose combined total HD does not exceed <B>4 x your skill score</B>. If this limit is exceeded, you choose which undead remain under your command; the rest become uncontrolled.<br>
<I>Skeletons:</I> require a mostly intact corpse with bones. If the body has flesh, it falls away as the spell takes effect.<br>
<I>Zombies:</I> require a mostly intact corpse of a creature with a true anatomy (flesh and organs).<br>
<I>Material:</I> A black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per HD of the undead must be placed into each corpse's mouth or eye socket. These gems are consumed when the spell is cast.<br>
<B>At Higher tiers:</B> When you cast this spell using a higher-tier spell slot, the number of undead you can animate increases by 4 HD for each tier above 3rd.x<br>
<br>


<br>
Antimagic Field <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> 10 ft.<br>
<B>Targets:</B> 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.<br>
An <I>antimagic field</I> suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an <I>antimagic field</I> counts against the suppressed spell's duration.<br>
Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an <I>antimagic field</I>. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast <I>antimagic field</I> in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has Magic Resistance, you use your skill check roll to determine if that creature is affected by the antimagic field. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an <I>antimagic field</I> because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)<br>
A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. <I>Dispel magic</I> does not remove the field.<br>
Two or more <I>antimagic fields</I> sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as <I>wall of force</I>, <I>prismatic sphere</I>, and <I>prismatic wall</I>, remain unaffected by <I>antimagic field</I> (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.<br>
Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.
<br><br>

Arcane Sight <br>
Divination<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Self<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute (D)<br>
This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a <I>detect magic</I> spell, but <I>arcane sight</I> does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.<br>
You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning tier or an item's magic strength. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell tier, or 15 + one-half item's level for nonspell effects.)<br>
If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, and the strength of the most powerful spell or supernatural ability the creature currently has available for use.<br>
<I>Arcane sight</I> can be made permanent with a <I>permanency</I> spell.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 7<br>
You automatically know which spells or magical effects are active upon any individual or object you see. It still doesn't let you identify magic items. Tier 7 <I>arcane sight</I> cannot be made permanent with a <I>permanency</I> spell.<br><br>

Augury<br>
Divination<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M(c), F(c)<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
An <I>augury</I> can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.<br>
The spell provides one of four results:<br>
&#149; Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).<br>
&#149; Woe (for bad results).<br>
&#149; Weal and woe (for both).<br>
&#149; Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).<br>
You have no way to know whether the result is accurate or if the spell failed.<br>
The augury looks only about half an hour into the future, so long-term consequences are not accounted for. Casting <I>augury</I> multiple times on the same topic gives the same result as the first casting.<br>
<I>Material Component:</I> Incense worth at least 25 gp.<br>
<I>Focus:</I> A set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp.<br>
<br>

Awaken<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 24 hours<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Animal or tree touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
You awaken a tree or animal to humanlike sentience. To succeed, your skill roll must be higher than the animal's current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened.<br>
The <I>awakened</I> animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it may serve you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.<br>
An <I>awakened</I> tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. It gains the ability to move limbs, roots, vines, and has senses similar to a human's.<br>
An <I>awakened</I> animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). It cannot serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.<br>
An <I>awakened</I> tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language you know for each point of Intelligence bonus it has (if any).<br>
<br>

Baleful Polymorph<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude negates, Will partial; see text<br>
As <I>polymorph</I>, except that you change the target into a Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD. If the new form would be immediately fatal, you attack the targets Fortitude with a -5 malus.<br>
If you succed, you must also attack will (using the same roll). If you succeed again the target loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and magical abilities, and adopts the Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma scores, and special abilities of the new form. It retains its core and ordinary skills.<br>
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being <I>polymorphed</I>. A creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.<br>
<br><br>

Barkskin<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Living creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<I>Barkskin</I> toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +1 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by +1 for each Tier above 2, up to a maximum of +5 at Tier 6.<br>
The enhancement bonus stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B><br>
Each Tier above 2 increases the enhancement bonus by +1, up to a maximum of +5 at Tier 6. Casting this spell with a slot above Tier 6 has no additional effect.<br><br>

Bear's Endurance<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates (harmless)<br>
The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the usual benefits to hit points, Constitution checks, Fortitude defence, and so forth.<br>
Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's Constitution drops back to normal and are not lost first as temporary hit points are.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 6<br>
When cast at Tier 6, <I>bear's endurance</I> can affect up to 10 creatures simultaneously, each of which must be within range.<br><br>

Bestow Curse<br>
Necromancy<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
You place a curse on the subject. Choose one of the following effects:<br>
&#149; -6 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).<br>
&#149; -4 penalty on attack rolls, defences, ability checks, and skill checks.<br>
&#149; Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.<br>
You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.<br>
The <I>curse</I> bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with <I>break enchantment</I>, <I>remove curse</I>, <I>limited wish</I>, <I>wish</I>, or <I>miracle</I>.<br>
<I>Bestow Curse</I> counters <I>Remove Curse</I>.<br><br>

Break Enchantment<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> See text<br>
This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. <I>Break enchantment</I> can reverse even an instantaneous effect. You make a power check (1d20 + skill) and compare for each effect against a DC of 10 + twice the effect's level. Success means the creature is freed from the effect or curse. For cursed magic items, the DC is 25.<br>
If the effect comes from a spell that cannot be dispelled by <I>dispel magic</I>, <I>break enchantment</I> works only if that spell is Tier 5 or lower.<br>
If the effect is caused by a permanent magic item, <I>break enchantment</I> does not remove the curse from the item, but does free the creature from its effects.<br><br>

Bull's Strength<br>

A cone of searing flame shoots from your fingertips. Any creature in the area of the flames takes 1d4 points of fire damage.<br>
Flammable materials burn if the flames touch them. A character can extinguish burning items as a full-round action.<br>
<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 2, 3<br>
The damage increases by 2d4 at each higher tier.<br><br>

Cat's Grace<br>

The transmuted creature becomes more graceful, agile, and coordinated. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, adding the usual benefits to AC, Reflex saves, and other uses of the Dexterity modifier.<br>
<br>

<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 10 creatures within 30 ft. of each other<br>

Chain Lightning<br>
Evocation [Electricity]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One primary target plus up to 10 secondary targets within 30 ft. of the primary target<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Reflex half<br>
This spell creates an electrical discharge beginning as a single strike from your fingertips. Unlike <I>lightning bolt</I>, <I>chain lightning</I> arcs from one initial target to multiple others.<br>
The primary target takes 6d6 electricity damage. Each secondary target takes half damage (3d6).<br>
Secondary targets must be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once.<br>

Charm<br>
Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One humanoid creature or animal<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
This charm makes a humanoid or animal regard you as a trusted friend and ally (treat attitude as friendly). If the target is threatened or attacked by you or allies, it gains +5 on its defence.<br>
The spell does not control the <I>charmed</I> creature like an automaton, but it views your words and actions favorably. You can issue orders, but must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything outside its normal behavior (no retries). It never obeys suicidal or clearly harmful orders but might accept risky ones. Any act by you or your allies that threatens the <I>charmed</I> creature breaks the spell. You must communicate in the creature's language or pantomime well.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Target:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> One day<br>
The effect ignores creature type or size.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Multiple creatures, no two more than 30 ft. apart<br>
<B>Duration:</B> One day<br>
It affects creatures whose combined Hit Dice do not exceed twice your tier, or at least one creature regardless of HD. If there are more potential targets than you can affect, choose them until the HD limit is exceeded.<br>

Cloudkill<br>
Conjuration (Creation)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude partial; see text<br>
This spell generates a bank of yellowish-green poisonous vapors. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD. To kill a living creature with 4 to 6 HD you need to succeed on a Fortitude attack. If you fail, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each turn while in the cloud.<br>
A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each turn while in the cloud if you succeed a Fortitude attack, or half of that otherwise. Holding one's breath doesn't help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected.<br>
The cloud moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.<br>
Each round, recalculate the cloud's spread based on its new origin point, 10 feet farther away from the original casting point.<br>
Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest land levels, pouring down openings such as dens or sinkholes. It cannot penetrate liquids and cannot be cast underwater.<br><br>

Color Spray<br>
Illusion (Pattern) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>

<B>Range:</B> Very Close<br>
<B>Area:</B> Cone-shaped burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous; see text<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly knocking them unconscious.<br>
Each creature within the cone is affected according to its Hit Dice.<br>
<I>2 HD or less:</I> The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.)<br>
<I>3 or 4 HD:</I> The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round.<br>
<I>5 or more HD:</I> The creature is stunned for 1 round.<br>
Sightless creatures are not affected by <I>color spray</I>.<br>

<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.<br>
<I>Approach:</I> On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.<br>
<I>Drop:</I> On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.<br>
<I>Fall:</I> On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.<br>
<I>Flee:</I> On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.<br>
<I>Halt:</I> The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.<br>
If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.<br>

<B>Area:</B> Cone-shaped burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Reflex half<br>
You unleash an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and extending outward in a cone. It drains heat from everything in its area, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).<br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> The spell deals an additional 2d6 cold damage for each tier above 5.<br>

<B>Targets:</B> Up to 20 HD of undead creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates<br>
This spell enables you to command undead creatures for a short period of time. You command them by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible, the controlled undead do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior.<br>
Intelligent undead creatures remember that you controlled them.<br><br>

Control Weather<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> 2 miles<br>
<B>Area:</B> 2-mile-radius circle centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 4d12 hours<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in.<br>

<table width="95%" border="1">
<tr><td><B>Season</B></td><td><B>Possible Weather</B></td></tr>
<tr><td>Spring</td><td>Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather</td></tr>
<tr><td>Summer</td><td>Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm</td></tr>
<tr><td>Autumn</td><td>Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet</td></tr>
<tr><td>Winter</td><td>Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw</td></tr>
<tr><td>Late winter</td><td>Hurricane-force winds or early spring (coastal area)</td></tr>
</table>

You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather—where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use an action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.<br>
Control Weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.<br>
<br>

Control Winds<br>
Transmutation [Air]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Area:</B> Cylinder with radius and height up to 400 meters<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude negates<br>
You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an “eye” of calm air up to 25 meters in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area smaller than your full limit.<br>

<B>Wind Direction:</B><br>
You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell's area:<br>
&#149; A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions.<br>
&#149; An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center, veering upward before impinging on the eye.<br>
&#149; A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion.<br>
&#149; A blast causes the winds to blow in one direction across the area.<br>

<B>Wind Strength:</B><br>
For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level. Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effects of the wind.<br><br>

Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.<br>
Severe winds (31+ mph) cause minor ship and building damage.<br>
Windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships.<br>
Hurricane-force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder.<br>
Tornado winds (175+ mph) destroy all nonfortified buildings and often uproot large trees.<br>
<br>

This spell allows you to create more powerful undead than basic animation. The type of undead you can create is based on the level at which you cast the spell, as shown in the table below.<br>

Created undead are not automatically under your control, though you may attempt to command them as they form if you are capable of doing so. The spell must be cast at night.<br>

<I>Material Component:</I> A clay pot filled with grave dirt, another with brackish water, and a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead, placed in the corpse's mouth or eye socket. The gem is consumed in the process.<br><br>

<B>At Higher Tiers:</B><br>
<ul>
  <li><B>Tier 2-4:</B> Heals an additional 1d8 per tier (max 4d8 at Tier 4). Still targets one creature.</li>

Darkness<br>
Evocation [Darkness]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Object touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>

You cause an object to radiate magical darkness in a 20-foot radius. The area is filled with shadowy illumination. All creatures within the area have concealment (20% miss chance). This concealment affects even creatures with darkvision or low-light vision.

Normal light sources and light spells of lower tier cannot brighten the area. <I>Darkness</I> counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower tier. If cast on a small object that is then covered with a lightproof material, the effect is blocked until uncovered.

<B>At Higher Tiers:</B><br>
<ul>
  <li><B>Tier 3:</B> The radius increases to 60 feet. Duration becomes 1 day. <I>Darkness</I> and <I>Daylight</I> of the same tier temporarily negate each other in overlapping areas.</li>
</ul>

Darkvision<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>

<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>

The target gains the ability to see in complete darkness as if it were dim light, up to a distance of 60 feet. This vision is black and white only but otherwise functions as normal sight.

<I>Darkvision</I> does not allow the target to see through magical darkness.
<br><br>

Daylight<br>
Evocation [Light]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Object touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>

The touched object radiates bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Creatures that suffer penalties in bright light are affected while within this area.

If <I>daylight</I> is cast on a small object and that object is enclosed in an opaque covering, the light is blocked until the covering is removed.

<I>Daylight</I> cancels or dispels magical darkness of equal or lower tier. If both effects are present in the same area, they are temporarily negated in the overlap.

Detect Magic<br>
Divination<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 0<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Far<br>
<B>Area:</B> Cone-shaped emanation<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration, up to 1 minute (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>

You sense magical auras within the area. The amount of information increases the longer you concentrate on a specific area or object:

<I>1st Round:</I> You detect the presence or absence of magic.<br>
<I>2nd Round:</I> You learn the number of auras and the strongest one's intensity.<br>
<I>3rd Round:</I> You learn the strength and location of each aura. If in line of sight, you may identify the magical school with a successful Arcana check (DC 15 + tier of spell, or 15 + half caster level for non-spell effects).

Aura strength depends on spell tier or item caster level (faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming). Magical areas or overlapping effects may obscure weaker auras.

<I>Lingering Auras:</I> Magic leaves behind residual traces even after the source fades or is destroyed. These show up as dim and persist based on the original aura's strength.

This spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or soil.
<br><br>

Detect Thoughts<br>
Divination [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Far<br>
<B>Area:</B> Cone-shaped emanation<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration, up to 1 minute (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will negates; see text<br>

You sense the surface thoughts of conscious minds in the area. The information revealed depends on how long you focus on the same zone or subject:

<I>1st Round:</I> You detect the presence or absence of thinking minds (Intelligence 1+).<br>
<I>2nd Round:</I> You learn the number of minds and their Intelligence scores. If any mind has an Intelligence of 26 or higher and it exceeds your own Intelligence by 10 or more, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.<br>
<I>3rd Round:</I> You can read the surface thoughts of any one mind in the area. A successful Will save prevents this, and you must cast the spell again to try again. Minds with low Intelligence (1-2) produce simple, instinctual thoughts.

The spell does not reveal the location of minds unless the creatures are visible. You may redirect the cone each round. The effect is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or soil.

Dimension Door<br>
Conjuration (Teleportation)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Target:</B> You and touched objects or one willing creature (up to Large size)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None and Will negates (object)<br>

You instantly transport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range (up to 50 meters). You arrive exactly where you intend, either by visualizing the destination or stating direction. After teleporting, you cannot take any further actions until your next turn.

You may bring along objects up to your maximum load. You can also bring one willing creature up to Large size (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) who is in physical contact with you.

If you arrive in a space occupied by a solid object or creature, you and all transported creatures take 1d6 damage and are shunted to a random free space on a suitable surface within 30 meters of the intended location.

If no free space exists within 30 meters, you and companions take an additional 2d6 damage and are shunted within 300 meters.

If no free space exists within 300 meters, you and companions take an additional 4d6 damage and the spell fails.

<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 5 creatures within range<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes (D)<br>
You make yourself and/or the targeted creatures—including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment—look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change body types. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure minor features or look like entirely different people.<br>
The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of the subjects or their equipment.<br>
If you use this spell to create a disguise, you gain a +10 bonus on the Disguise check.<br>
A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier (5):</B><br>
<B>Range:</B> Close <br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 5 creatures, no two targets more than 30 ft. apart<br>

To affect unwilling targets you have to succeed a Will attack.<br><br>

Dispel Magic<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Target or Area:</B> One spellcaster, creature, or object; or 20-ft.-radius burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
You can use <I>dispel magic</I> to end ongoing spells cast on a creature or object, temporarily suppress magical abilities of magic items, end ongoing spells within an area, or counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration expired. Some effects cannot be dispelled.<br>
Note: Spells with instantaneous duration cannot be dispelled.<br>

You choose one mode when casting:<br>
<I>Targeted Dispel:</I> You target one object, creature, or spell and compare your skill roll (1d20 + your skill level, max +10) against each ongoing spell affecting the target. The DC for each dispel check is 10 + (2 * the spell's tier). Success dispels that spell.<br>
- If the target is a magic item, a successful check suppresses its magical properties for 1d4 rounds.<br>
- You automatically succeed against spells you cast.<br>

<I>Area Dispel:</I> You affect everything within a 20-foot radius burst. For each creature or object with ongoing spells, comppare the skill roll against the highest tier spell first, then weaker spells until one is dispelled or none is. Magic items are not affected. You can also attempt to dispel ongoing area or effect spells originating or overlapping within the burst.<br>

<I>Counterspell:</I> Target a spellcaster and attempt to counter a spell.<br>

<B>At Higher Tier (6):</B><br>
- The maximum bonus on dispel checks increases from +10 to +20. The malus to the skill roll is only applied for the purpose of using power pool, but you still use the full skill for this roll.<br>
- Additionally, you may attempt to dispel effects that <I>remove curse</I> can remove, even if normally unaffected by dispel magic.<br><br>

Dominate Person<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Range:</B> Very Far<br>
<B>Target:</B> One humanoid<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 days<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Will negates<br>
You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind.<br>
If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as “Come here,” “Go there,” “Fight,” and “Stand still.” You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.<br>
Once you have given a <I>dominated</I> creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, an Intuition check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect.<br>
Changing your instructions or giving a <I>dominated</I> creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.<br>
By concentrating fully on the spell (an action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.<br>
Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out.<br>
Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.<br>
If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.<br>
<I>Protection from evil</I> or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 9<br>

<B>Saving Throw:</B> Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> —<br>
The target becomes more poised, articulate, and personally forceful. It gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma, improving Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. This does not grant bonus Power Points or spells known, but does increase the DC of abilities and spells cast while the bonus is active.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 6<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude negates<br>
The target instantly grows in size, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This changes its size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (minimum 1), and takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to increased size.<br>
A humanoid that becomes Large has a space of 3 meters and a natural reach of 3 meters. This spell does not alter speed.<br>
All worn and carried equipment enlarges accordingly. Melee and projectile weapons deal more damage due to their size. Items revert to normal size once they leave the creature’s possession. Magical properties are not affected.<br>
If growth is constrained, the creature grows as much as possible and may make a Strength check (with the enhanced Strength bonus) to burst the enclosure. If it fails, it is simply trapped by the environment.<br>
Multiple magical effects that alter size do not stack.<br>
