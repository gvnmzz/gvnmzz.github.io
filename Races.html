        A race is not a rigid mechanical package but a collection of racial skills that reflect what your character can
        innately do because of their culture, physiology, or inborn instincts. These skills define your natural
        affinities, physical traits, or social conditioning — whether you're an elf, a dwarf, or something entirely new.
        They also provide a framework for your character's background, allowing you to roleplay your character more
        effectively.

        We provide examples of common fantasy ancestries such as dwarves, elves, and halflings, but these are just
        templates. You are encouraged to adapt or create your own races to suit the lore and themes of your world or
        campaign. Use the examples as inspiration, not limits.
        <br><br>

        CREATING A RACE<br>
        When you create a character, you receive 20 XR to spend on racial skills. These points represent the latent
        traits and instincts passed down through bloodlines, heritage, or cultural immersion.<br>

        Some abilities — such as Darkvision, Low-Light Vision, or Natural Weapons — can only be taken as racial skills,
        unless a compelling narrative justification is approved by the DM. In general, if a trait is biological or
        deeply cultural, it belongs to the race.<br>

        We do not tie ability score modifiers to races. Your Strength, Intelligence, or Charisma are personal
        attributes, not fixed by your ancestry. This approach emphasizes the diversity and individuality of characters
        within each race — your elf can be tough, your orc can be wise.<br><br>

        SMALL CHARACTERS<br>
        A Small character gets a +1 size bonus to Defense, and a starting score of 4 to Stealth.<br>
        A Small character's carrying capacity is three-quarters of that of a Medium character.<br>
        A Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as a Medium character.<br>
        A Small character is restricted to use smaller weapons.<br>

        RACE AND LANGUAGES <br>
        All characters know how to speak Common. A dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, or halfling also speaks a
        racial language, as appropriate. A character who has an Intelligence bonus at 1st level speaks other languages
        as well, one extra language per point of Intelligence bonus as a starting character.<br><br>

        HUMANS<br>
    </font>
    <font size="3">
        Humans are the most adaptable ancestry and start with 20 XR to spend freely on racial skills of your choice.
        They have no preset traits — their defining feature is versatility. Any other race can be built starting from
        the human template, adding specific racial skills to reflect their unique heritage.<br><br>

        &#149; Medium: As Medium creatures, humans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size. <br>
        &#149; Human base land speed is 30 feet. <br>
        &#149; 20 extra Experience Rolls at creation.<br>
        &#149; Automatic Language: Common. Bonus Languages: Any (other than secret languages, such as Druidic). See the
        Speak Language skill.<br>

    </font>
    <font size="5"><br>
        DWARVES<br>
    </font>
    <font size="3">
        &#149; Medium: As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.<br>
        &#149; Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or
        heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such
        situations).<br>
        &#149; Darkvision: Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is
        otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves can function just fine with no light at all.<br>
        &#149; Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 bonus on Perception checks to notice unusual stonework,
        such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone
        surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as stone also
        counts as unusual stonework. The passive Perception regarding unusual stonework also has a bonus of +2. A dwarf
        can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is
        up. <br>
        &#149; Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves have a starting score of 2 to Battleaxe and Warhammer.<br>
        &#149; Stability: A dwarf gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when
        standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the
        ground).<br>
        &#149; Dwarves have a +2 bonus on Fortitude against poison.<br>
        &#149; Dwarves have a bonus of +2 on Craft and Appraise checks related to metal or stone.<br>
        &#149; Automatic Languages: Common and Dwarven. Bonus Languages: Giant, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Terran, and
        Undercommon.<br>

        ELVES<br>
    </font>

        &#149; Elf base land speed is 30 feet.<br>
        &#149; Immunity to magic sleep effects, and a +2 saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or effects.<br>
        &#149; Low-Light Vision: An elf can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar
        conditions of poor illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these
        conditions.<br>
        &#149; Weapon Proficiency: Elves have a starting score of 2 in longsword, rapier, longbow and shortbow. For
        them, longsowrd and rapier are considered to be in the same weapon group.<br>
        &#149; Elves have a starting score of 2 in Perception.<br>
        &#149; Automatic Languages: Common and Elven. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, and
        Sylvan.<br>

    <font size="5"><br>
        GNOMES<br>
    </font>
    <font size="3">
        &#149; Small: As a Small creature, a gnome gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, and a starting score of 4 to
        Stealth, has to use smaller weapons, and his lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium
        character.<br>
        &#149; Gnome base land speed is 20 feet.<br>
        &#149; Low-Light Vision: A gnome can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and
        similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these
        conditions.<br>
        &#149; +2 bonus on Fortitude, Reflex and Will against spells and spells effects.<br>
        &#149; A starting score of 2 to Perpception.<br>

        &#149; Automatic Languages: Common and Gnome. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, and Orc.
        In addition, a gnome can speak with a burrowing mammal (a badger, fox, rabbit, or the like, see below). This
        ability is innate to gnomes. See the <I>speak with animals </I>spell description.<br>
        &#149; A starting score of 1 to <I>speak with animals </I>(burrowing mammal only, duration 1 minute). A gnome
        with a Charisma score of at least 10 also has a starting score of 1 in the following magical skills: <I>dancing
            lights</I>, <I>ghost sound</I>, <I>prestidigitation</I>, <I>minor image</I>. <br>

        &#149; Relentless Endurance: When an half-orc is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, they can drop

        CREATING A CHARACTER<br>
    </font>
    <font size="3">
        When creating a new character, you need to decide the power level of the campaign to assign a certain number of
        Experience Rolls (XR).
        A standard character should start its career with 30 XR, but nothing prevents to start with more or less.
        You might want to start with more XR than the standard. To give a frame of reference, 30XR correspond to a 1st
        level character in D&D, 100XR correspond to a 5th level character, 200XR correspond to 10th level, 325XR
        correspond to 15th level, 750XR correspond to 20th level.<br>

        <br>
        To make the process quicker, here are the tables showing the average number of rolls needed to get to a certain
        skill level:<br>
