Acid Arrow  <br>
Conjuration (Creation) [Acid]<br>
<b>Tier:</b> 2<br>
<b>Components:</b> V, S, F<br>
<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
<b>Range:</b> Far<br>
<b>Target:</b> One creature<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 round or more, see text<br>
<b>Defence:</b> AC<br>
You conjure and launch a glowing green bolt of acidic energy from your focus. The bolt flies straight toward a creature within far reach. You must make a ranged spell attack against the target's AC.<br>
On a hit, the bolt deals <b>2d4 acid damage</b>. The corrosive magic continues to burn, dealing <b>2d4 acid damage at the start of the target's next turn</b>.<br>
When cast using a higher-tier spell slot:<br>
— <b>3rd Tier:</b> Burns for 2 rounds total (initial + 1 round)<br>
— <b>4th Tier:</b> Burns for 3 rounds total<br>
— <b>5th Tier or higher:</b> Burns for 4 rounds total (maximum)<br>
The acid effect ends early if it is neutralized or magically removed.<br>
<b>Special:</b> This spell is not affected by Magic Resistance.<br>
<br>

Acid Fog<br>
Conjuration (Creation) [Acid]<br>
<b>Tier:</b> 6<br>
<b>Components:</b> V, S, F<br>
<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
<b>Range:</b> Very far<br>
<b>Area:</b> 20-meter radius, 6 meters high<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 11 rounds<br>
<b>Defence:</b> None<br>
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> No<br>
You conjure a dense cloud of acidic mist that spreads rapidly from the point of origin. The fog obscures vision and turns the area into difficult terrain.<br>
Each round on your turn, including when it is cast, every creature and unattended object within the fog takes <b>2d6 acid damage</b>. The fog's corrosive effect persists for the duration unless magically dispersed or neutralized.<br><br>

Acid Splash <br>
Conjuration (Creation) [Acid]<br>
<B>Tier: </B>0<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close <br>
<B>Effect:</B> One missile of acid<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> AC<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You fire a small orb of acid at the target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The orb deals 1d3 points of acid damage.<br>
<br>

Aid<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<b>Tier:</b> 2<br>
<b>Components:</b> V, S, F<br>
<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
<b>Range:</b> Reach<br>
<b>Target:</b> One living creature<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 3 minutes<br>
<b>Defence:</b> None<br>
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)<br>
You touch an ally, infusing them with resolve and vitality. The target gains a <b>+1 morale bonus</b> to attack rolls and on defence against fear effects. In addition, the target gains <b>1d8 + skill score</b> temporary hit points (to a maximum of 1d8 + 10).<br>
These temporary hit points last for the duration or until lost.<br>
<br>

Air Walk<br>
Transmutation [Air]<br>
<b>Tier:</b> 4<br>
<b>Components:</b> V, S, F<br>
<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
<b>Range:</b> Reach<br>
<b>Target:</b> One creature (Gargantuan or smaller)<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 70 minutes<br>
<b>Defence:</b> None<br>
<b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)<br>
The target can walk through the air as though it were solid ground. It can ascend or descend at an angle of up to 45 degrees, but does so at half its normal walking speed.<br>
<br>
A strong wind (over 20 mph) affects the target's movement. At the end of each round, the target is pushed 5 feet for every 5 mph of wind speed. In turbulent conditions, the target may lose control or take damage at the referee's discretion.<br>
<br>
If the spell ends while the creature is still aloft, it descends slowly—floating down 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that time, it lands safely. Otherwise, it falls the remaining distance and takes falling damage as normal.<br>
<br>
This spell is cast through your focus, allowing you to direct the effect without physical contact.<br>
<br>
You may also cast this spell on a specially trained mount, allowing it to be ridden through the air. Training a mount for this requires one week of work and a successful Handle Animal check (DC 25).<br>
<br>

Alarm <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Area:</B> 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 3 hours (dismissible)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
<I>Alarm</I> creates a magical ward that detects intrusion. It triggers when a creature of Tiny or larger size enters or touches the area. You choose whether the <I>alarm</I> is audible or mental when casting. Creatures that speak a designated password (set during casting) do not trigger the <I>alarm</I>.<br>
<I>Mental Alarm:</I> Alerts only you, provided you're within 1 mile. The signal is a single mental ping that awakens you from sleep but does not otherwise disturb you. It functions even in a <I>silence</I> spell.<br>
<I>Audible Alarm:</I> Produces a clear ringing (like a hand bell) that lasts 1 round and is heard within 60 feet. Closed doors reduce this distance by 10 feet; walls reduce it by 20 feet. In quiet conditions, it may be faintly heard up to 180 feet away. The ringing is blocked by a <I>silence</I> spell.<br>
Ethereal and astral creatures do not trigger the <I>alarm</I>.<br>
This spell is cast through your focus, allowing you to ward an area without touching it.<br>
<I>Alarm</I> may be made permanent with a <I>permanency</I> spell.<br><br>

Align Weapon <br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target: </B>Weapon touched or fifty projectiles (all of which must be in contact at the time of casting)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 3 minutes<br>
<B>Defence: </B>Will negates (harmless, object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless, object)<br>
<I>Align weapon </I>makes a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as you choose. A weapon that is aligned can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures. This spell has no effect on a weapon that already has an alignment.<br>
You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike.<br><br>

Analyze Dweomer <br>
Divination<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F(c)<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Far<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 10 objects or creatures<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None or Will negates (see text)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You discern all spells and magical properties affecting a number of creatures or objects. Each round, without using an action, you can examine one visible target. For a magic item, you learn all magical functions, how to activate them (if applicable), and the number of charges remaining. For a creature or object affected by spells, you learn each active spell, its effect, and tier.<br>
If an attended object is examined, its holder may allow it to resist with and you'll have to make an attack against Will. On a failed attack, you detect only visible properties. An object that resists cannot be affected again by <I>analyze dweomer</I> for 24 hours.<br>
<I>Analyze dweomer</I> reveals nothing about artifacts.<br>
The spell requires a specially prepared ruby or sapphire lens set in a golden loop worth at least 1,500 gp, used as a focus.<br><br>

Animal Growth <br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 4 animals (Gargantuan or smaller), no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart. For each tier above 5th, you may target one additional animal.<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Fortitude<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You enlarge a number of animals, causing them to grow to twice their size and roughly eight times their weight. Each affected animal's size category increases by one step. It gains a +8 size bonus to Strength, a +4 size bonus to Constitution (granting +2 hit points per Hit Die), and a -2 size penalty to Dexterity. Its natural armor increases by 2.<br>
The creature's attack rolls, AC, and damage change according to its new size. Its space and reach adjust as appropriate, but its speed remains unchanged.<br>
Additionally, the creature gains damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus to all defences.<br>
If there isn't enough room to grow, the creature reaches the maximum size possible and may make a Strength check (using the increased score) to burst through obstacles. If it fails, it is constrained but unharmed.<br>
All carried and worn gear grows with the animal, though magical properties remain unaffected. Items return to normal size when removed from the creature.<br>
This spell does not grant control over the affected animals. Size increases from multiple magical effects do not stack.<br><br>

Animal Messenger <br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Target:</B> One Tiny animal<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 day<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You compel a Tiny animal to travel to a location you designate. This is commonly used to send a simple message or small item to a known location or person. The animal must be free and untamed—it cannot be a familiar, companion, or trained creature.<br>
You mentally impress the animal with a destination that must be familiar to you or marked by a clear landmark. Directions must be simple; the animal cannot navigate to a place it doesn't understand. You may attach a small object or written note to the messenger.<br>
The animal travels to the location, then waits there until the spell ends. During this time, it allows others to approach and retrieve the item or message. The recipient does not gain any magical ability to understand or communicate with the animal.<br>
The spell requires a small token of food or a treat as a focus, which the animal consumes during the casting.<br><br>

Animal Shapes <br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 15 willing creatures, all within 30 ft. of each other<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 day<br>
You transform up to 15 willing creatures into animals of your choice. All creatures must assume the same animal form. The spell has no effect on unwilling creatures.<br>
Each target retains their mental abilities but gains the physical statistics and traits of the chosen animal form. The assumed form must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than the subject's own Hit Dice or your skill score in Magic (whichever is lower), to a maximum of 20 HD.<br>
Each target remains in animal form for the duration of the spell, unless they choose to revert. Reverting is a full-round action and ends the spell for that individual creature only. The spell ends for all recipients if dismissed by the caster.<br>
The spell requires a miniature totem or carving of the chosen animal as a focus.<br><br>

Animal Trance <br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting, Sonic]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 4 animals or magical beasts with Intelligence 1 or 2, within 30 ft. of each other<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Will (see text)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
Your swaying motions and music (or singing, or chanting) compel animals and magical beasts to do nothing but watch you. Only a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 can be fascinated by this spell. Roll 2d6 to determine the total number of HD worth of creatures that you fascinate. The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected.<br>
You attack the Will of a magical beast, a dire animal, or an animal trained to attack or guard, while you automatically succeed with an animal not trained to attack or guard.<br>
<br>

<B>Animate Dead</B><br>
Necromancy [Evil]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One or more corpses touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell animates corpses into skeletons or zombies that obey your spoken commands. You can direct them to follow you or to remain in a location and attack intruders. They remain animated until destroyed and cannot be reanimated again.<br>
You can animate up to <B>10 Hit Dice (HD)</B> worth of undead. You choose the mix of skeletons and zombies, but must meet the anatomical requirements (see below).<br>
Although the undead are permanent, you can only control a number of undead whose combined total HD does not exceed <B>4 x your skill score</B>. If this limit is exceeded, you choose which undead remain under your command; the rest become uncontrolled.<br>
<I>Skeletons:</I> require a mostly intact corpse with bones. If the body has flesh, it falls away as the spell takes effect.<br>
<I>Zombies:</I> require a mostly intact corpse of a creature with a true anatomy (flesh and organs).<br>
<I>Material:</I> A black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per HD of the undead must be placed into each corpse's mouth or eye socket. These gems are consumed when the spell is cast.<br>
<B>At Higher tiers:</B> When you cast this spell using a higher-tier spell slot, the number of undead you can animate increases by 4 HD for each tier above 3rd.x<br>
<br>


<B>Animate Objects</B><br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Far<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One Small or smaller object per base limit; see text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. Each animated object immediately attacks creatures or targets you designate. You can redirect their attacks as a move action.<br>
You can animate up to <B>10 Small or smaller objects</B>, or an equivalent number of larger objects. A Medium object counts as two Small, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two.<br>
Objects must be nonmagical and unattended. You cannot animate items worn or carried by a creature.<br>
<I>Animate Objects</I> can be made permanent with the <I>Permanency</I> spell.<br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> When you cast this spell using a higher-tier spell slot, you can animate 2 additional Small or smaller objects (or their equivalents) per tier above 6th.<br>
<br>

<B>Animate Plants</B><br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to 4 Large or smaller plants or equivalent, or all plants within range; see text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute or 12 hours; see text<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life. Each animated plant immediately attacks creatures or targets you designate, behaving as animated objects of equivalent size. You may animate up to <b>4 Large or smaller plants</b>, or their equivalents: a Huge plant counts as two Large, a Gargantuan plant as four. You cannot animate a Colossal plant unless casting this spell at 9th tier or higher.<br>
You can redirect animated plants as a move action. Animated plants must be alive but non-sentient; plant creatures and dead wood are unaffected.<br>
Use statistics for animated objects, though plants smaller than Large usually lack hardness.<br>
Alternatively, you can animate all plants in the area to entangle creatures, replicating the effect of an <i>Entangle</i> spell. This version lasts 12 hours and is not negated by spell resistance.<br>
Casting this spell requires a focus implement.<br>
<B>At Higher Tiers:</B> When you cast this spell as 9th tier, you may animate a Colossal plant.<br><br>


<B>Animate Rope</B><br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Medium<br>
<B>Targets:</B> One nonliving ropelike object, up to 50 ft. long<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Defence:</B> Reflex<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You animate a single rope or similar object, up to 50 feet in length and 1 inch in diameter. The length is halved for each additional inch of thickness, or increased by 50% for each halving of diameter.<br>
The rope can follow simple commands such as “coil,” “knot,” “loop,” and their opposites, one per round. It must be within 1 foot of a target to interact with it—it does not extend on its own. To entangle a creature, you must throw it successfully with a ranged touch attack (range increment 10 ft).<br>
To hit a target you must attack the Reflex defence. A hit target becomes <i>entangled</i>. An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check. A bound spellcaster reduced the effective skill score to cast spell by 15. The rope has no magical properties once tied.<br>
This spell grants a +2 bonus on Bondage Mastery checks when using the transmuted rope.<br>
The spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.<br><br>

Antilife Shell <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 round<br>
<B>Range:</B> 10 ft.<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Living creatures within a 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that prevents the entrance of most types of living creatures.<br>
The effect hedges out animals, aberrations, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, oozes, plants, and vermin, but not constructs, elementals, outsiders, or undead.<br>
This spell may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.<br>

<br>
Antimagic Field <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> 10 ft.<br>
<B>Targets:</B> 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour (D)<br>
<B>Defence:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> See text<br>
An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.<br>
An <I>antimagic field</I> suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an <I>antimagic field</I> counts against the suppressed spell's duration.<br>
Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an <I>antimagic field</I>. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast <I>antimagic field</I> in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you use your skill check roll with a -5 malus to decide if that creature is affected by the antimagic field. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an <I>antimagic field</I> because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)<br>
A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. <I>Dispel magic</I> does not remove the field.<br>
Two or more <I>antimagic fields</I> sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as <I>wall of force</I>, <I>prismatic sphere</I>, and <I>prismatic wall</I>, remain unaffected by <I>antimagic field</I> (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.<br>
Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.
<br><br>

Antipathy <br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 hour<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per two caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One location (up to a 10-ft. cube per caster level) or one object<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 2 hours per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will partial<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named.<br>
Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item.<br>
A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's Dexterity score by 4 points.<br>
<I>Antipathy </I>counters and dispels <I>sympathy</I>.<br>

<br>
Antiplant Shell <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> 10 ft.<br>
<B>Area:</B> 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
The <I>antiplant shell </I>spell creates an invisible, mobile barrier that keeps all creatures within the shell protected from attacks by plant creatures or animated plants. As with many abjuration spells, forcing the barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay strains and collapses the field.<br>
<br>

Arcane Eye <br>
Divination (Scrying)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Unlimited<br>
<B>Effect: </B>Magical sensor<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can create the <I>arcane eye </I>at any point you can see, but it can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. An <I>arcane eye </I>travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there.<br>
The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can't enter another plane of existence, even through a <I>gate </I>or similar magical portal.<br>
You must concentrate to use an <I>arcane eye. </I>If you do not concentrate, the eye is inert until you again concentrate.<br>
<br>

Arcane Lock <br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> The door, chest, or portal touched, up to 30 sq. ft. per caster level in size<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
An <I>arcane lock </I>spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. You can freely pass your own <I>arcane lock </I>without affecting it; otherwise, a door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful <I>dispel magic </I>or <I>knock </I>spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. (A <I>knock </I>spell does not remove an <I>arcane lock; </I>it only suppresses the effect for 10 minutes.)<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>Gold dust worth 25 gp.<br>
<br>

Arcane Mark <br>
Universal<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 0<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> 0 ft.<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One personal rune or mark, all of which must fit within 1 sq. ft.<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An <I>arcane mark </I>spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a <I>detect magic </I>spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.<br>
<I>See invisibility, true seeing</I>, a <I>gem of seeing</I>, or a <I>robe of eyes </I>likewise allows the user to see an invisible <I>arcane mark. </I>A <I>read magic </I>spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an <I>erase </I>spell.<br>
If an <I>arcane mark </I>is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month.<br>
<I>Arcane mark </I>must be cast on an object prior to casting <I>instant summons </I>on the same object (see that spell description for details).<br>

Arcane Sight <br>
Divination<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a <I>detect magic </I>spell, but <I>arcane sight </I>does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.<br>
You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the <I>detect magic </I>spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect.)<br>
If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.<br>
<I>Arcane sight </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell.<br>
<B>At Higher Tier:</B> 7<br>
You automatically know which spells or magical effects are active upon any individual or object you see. It still doesn't let you identify magic items. 7th level <I>Arcane sight </I>cannot be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I> spell.<br>

Astral Projection<br>
Necromancy<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 9<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 30 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> You plus one additional willing creature touched per two skill score<br>
<B>Duration:</B> See text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether.<br>
You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.<br>
You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.<br>
While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.<br>
You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as <I>dispel magic </I>cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>A jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp, plus a silver bar worth 5 gp for each person to be affected.<br>

<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
An <I>augury </I>can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.<br>
The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the <I>augury </I>succeeds, you get one of four results:<br>
&#149; Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).<br>
&#149; Woe (for bad results).<br>
&#149; Weal and woe (for both).<br>
&#149; Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).<br>
If the spell fails, you get the &#147;nothing&#148; result. If you get the &#147;nothing&#148; result you have no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful <I>augury.<br>
</I>The <I>augury </I>can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All <I>auguries </I>cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as the first casting.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>Incense worth at least 25 gp.<br>
<I>Focus: </I>A set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens of at least 25 gp value.<br>

<B>Target:</B> Animal or tree touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You awaken a tree or animal to humanlike sentience. To succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + the animal's current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened).<br>
The <I>awakened </I>animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.<br>
An <I>awakened </I>tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. An <I>awakened </I>plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human's.<br>
An <I>awakened </I>animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An awakened animal can't serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.<br>
An <I>awakened </I>tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any).<br>

<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
As <I>polymorph, </I>except that you change the subject into a Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD. If the new form would prove fatal to the creature the subject makes the save with advantage.<br>
If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a Will save. If this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and magical skills, and gains the special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own. It still retains its core and ordinary skills.<br>
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being <I>polymorphed</I>, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A <I>banishment </I>spell is a more powerful version of the <I>dismissal </I>spell. It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished.<br>
You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target's spell resistance (if any), the saving throw DC increases by 2. <br>
Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against spell resistance and increasing the save DC by 4).<br>
<I>Arcane Focus: </I>Any item that is distasteful to the subject (optional, see above).<br>

<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
<I>Barkskin </I>toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every at skill scores 4, 8 and 12, to a maximum of +5.<br>
The enhancement bonus provided by <I>barkskin </I>stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.<br>

The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the usual benefits to hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so forth.<br>
Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's Constitution drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.<br>

You place a curse on the subject. Choose one of the following three effects.<br>
&#149; &#150;6 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).<br>
&#149; &#150;4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks.<br>
&#149; Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.<br>
You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.<br>
The <I>curse </I>bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a <I>break enchantment</I>, <I>limited wish</I>, <I>miracle</I>, <I>remove curse</I>, or <I>wish </I>spell.<br>

Binding<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> One minute<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per two caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> See text (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A <I>binding </I>spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.<br>
You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts <I>suggestion</I>, your caster level for this casting of <I>binding </I>increases by 1. For each assistant who casts <I>dominate animal, dominate person, </I>or <I>dominate monster, </I>your caster level for this casting of <I>binding </I>increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's skill score in the spell cast, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a <I>binding </I>spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <I>binding </I>spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the <I>binding </I>lasts. All <I>binding </I>spells are dismissible.<br>
Regardless of the version of <I>binding </I>you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.<br>
If you are casting any of the first three versions of <I>binding </I>(those with limited durations), you may cast additional <I>binding </I>spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the <I>binding </I>spells it has received are broken.<br>
The <I>binding </I>spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.<br>
<I>Chaining: </I>The subject is confined by restraints that generate an <I>antipathy </I>spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of <I>binding </I>is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.<br>
<I>Slumber: </I>This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while <I>slumbering</I>, nor does it age. This form of <I>binding </I>is more difficult to cast than <I>chaining</I>, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.<br>
<I>Bound Slumber: </I>This combination of <I>chaining </I>and <I>slumber </I>lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.<br>
<I>Hedged Prison: </I>The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.<br>
<I>Metamorphosis: </I>The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <I>binding </I>is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <I>metamorphosed</I>, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.<br>
<I>Minimus Containment: </I>The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The <I>binding </I>is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <I>contained</I>, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.<br>
You can't dispel a <I>binding </I>spell with <I>dispel magic </I>or a similar effect, though an <I>antimagic field </I>or <I>Mage's disjunction </I>affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to <I>dismissal, banishment, </I>or a similar effect.<br>
<I>Components: </I>The components for a <I>binding </I>spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of <I>binding </I>used. These components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals, soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for <I>slumber </I>bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like.<br>
In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of <I>binding </I>(cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot&#151;including water. They grasp and entwine around creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength.<br>
Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the grapple check of the tentacles. Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with an attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19. Thus, its grapple check modifier is equal to your caster level +8. The tentacles are immune to all types of damage.<br>
Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.<br>
Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles. Even creatures who aren't grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> Reflex half or Reflex negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force springs into existence. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for half damage.<br>
If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save.<br>
A <I>blade barrier </I>provides cover against attacks made through it.<br>

The effects are cumulative and concurrent.<br>
No saving throw is allowed against these effects.<br>
<I>Dazed: </I>The creature can take no actions for 1 round, though it defends itself normally.<br>
<I>Weakened: </I>The creature's Strength score decreases by 2d6 points for 2d4 rounds.<br>
<I>Paralyzed: </I>The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes.<br>
<I>Killed: </I>Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.<br>
Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonevil extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the <I>blasphemy. </I>The banishment effect allows a Will save (at disadvantage) to negate.<br>
Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected by <I>blasphemy.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes. The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing the damage reduction of evil creatures or striking evil incorporeal creatures (though the spell doesn't grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon also becomes good, which means it can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures. (This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the weapon might have.) Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but affected projectile weapons (such as bows) don't confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot.<br>
In addition, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are automatically successful, so every threat is a critical hit. This last effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits, such as a keen weapon or a vorpal sword.<br>

Blink<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D)<br>
You &#147;blink&#148; back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.<br>
<I>Blinking </I>has several effects, as follows.<br>
Physical attacks against are made at disadvantage, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attacker is capable of seeing invisible creatures and striking ethereal creatures, there is no disadvantage.<br>
Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're <I>blinking </I>unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Likewise, your own spells have a 50% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.<br>
While <I>blinking</I>, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature but you also have a chance to shift to the ethereal plane at random, so your attacks don't have neither advantage nor disadvantage.<br>
You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.<br>
While <I>blinking</I>, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)<br>
Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.<br>
An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.<br>
An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.<br>
Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.<br>

Illusion (Glamer)<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting and wavering. Attacks against the subject have disadvantage.<br>
A <I>see invisibility </I>spell does not counteract the <I>blur </I>effect, but a <I>true seeing </I>spell does.<br>
Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).<br>
Attacks that don't rely on sight are immune to this effect, as with blindsight.<br>

Break Enchantment<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Tier:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 minute<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per two caster levels)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to one creature per level, all within 30 ft. of each other<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> See text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. <I>Break enchantment </I>can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.<br>
If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by <I>dispel magic</I>, <I>break enchantment </I>works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. <br>
If the effect comes from some permanent magic item <I>break enchantment </I>does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects. <br>
