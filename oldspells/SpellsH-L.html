        <I>Hallow </I>makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site. This has four major effects.<br>
        First, the site or structure is guarded by a <I>magic circle against evil </I>effect.<br>
        Second, all Charisma checks made to turn undead gain a +4 sacred bonus, and Charisma checks to command undead
        take a &#150;4 penalty. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. (This provision does not apply to the
        druid version of the spell.)<br>
        Third, any dead body interred in a <I>hallowed </I>site cannot be turned into an undead creature.<br>
        Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the <I>hallowed </I>site. The spell effect lasts for one
        year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may
        designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures
        who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be
        renewed or replaced simply by casting <I>hallow </I>again.<br>
        Spell effects that may be tied to a <I>hallowed </I>site include <I>aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness,
            daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect evil, detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel
            magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist
            energy, silence, tongues, </I>and <I>zone of truth</I>. Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to
        these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)<br>
        An area can receive only one <I>hallow </I>spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. <I>Hallow
        </I>counters but does not dispel <I>unhallow</I>.<br>
        <I>Material Component: </I>Herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the
        spell to be included in the <I>hallowed </I>area.<br>

        <B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
        You make natural terrain look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Structures, equipment,
        and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance.<br>
        <B>At Higher Level:</B> 5<br>
        <B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
        <B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
        <B>Area:</B> One 20-ft. cube per caster level (S)<br>
        <B>Duration:</B> Concentration +1 hour/ level (D)<br>
        You can make any area appear to be something other than it is. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile,
        and olfactory elements. You can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where none are present). Still,
        it can't disguise, conceal, or add creatures (though creatures within the area might hide themselves within the
        illusion just as they can hide themselves within a real location).<br>

        <B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (see text)<br>
        <B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
        This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving
        throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile
        for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of <I>hold person </I>on a living creature). The effect is
        broken if the <I>halted </I>creatures are attacked or take damage.<br>
        <br>
        Harm<br>

        <B>Saving Throw: </B>Will half; see text<br>
        <B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
        <I>Harm </I>charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum
        of 150 points at 15th level). If the creature successfully saves, <I>harm </I>deals half this amount, but it
        cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than 1.<br>
        If used on an undead creature, <I>harm </I>acts like <I>heal</I>.<br>
        <br>
        Haste<br>
        Transmutation<br>
        <B>Level:</B> 3<br>
        <B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
        <B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
        <B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
        <B>Targets:</B> One creature per caster level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
        <B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level<br>
        <B>Saving Throw:</B> Fortitude negates (harmless)<br>
        <B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
        The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.<br>
        When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The
        attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation.
        (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it
        actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in
        the round.)<br>
        A <I>hasted </I>creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any
        condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge
        bonuses.<br>
        All of the <I>hasted </I>creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim)
        increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase
        counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased
        speed.<br>
        Multiple <I>haste </I>effects don't stack. <I>Haste </I>dispels and counters <I>slow</I>.<br>

        <B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
        <B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
        <I>Heal </I>enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It
        immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the Target: ability damage, blinded,
        <I>confused, </I>dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, <I>feebleminded, </I>insanity,
        nauseated, sickened, stunned, and poisoned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a
        maximum of 150 points at 15th level.<br>
        <I>Heal </I>does not remove negative levels, restore permanently drained levels, or restore permanently drained
        ability score points.<br>
        If used against an undead creature, <I>heal </I>instead acts like <I>harm</I>.<br>

        <B>Target: </B>Metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or
        25 lb. of metal per caster level, all of which must be within a 30-ft. circle<br>
        <B>Duration:</B> 7 rounds<br>
        <B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (object)<br>
        <B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (object)<br>
        <I>Heat metal </I>makes metal extremely warm. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal
        is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw
        bonus unless its own is higher.<br>
        A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it
        is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum
        damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying
        weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.<br>
        On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same
        effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last)
        round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot,
        causing more damage, as shown on the table below.<br>

    You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to find a creature within 5 miles. The hand then beckons
    to that creature and leads it to you if the creature is willing to follow.<br>
    When the spell is cast, the hand appears in front of you. You then specify a person (or any creature) by physical
    description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or
    class. When the description is complete, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The
    amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away she is.<br>

    Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it. If the subject does so, the hand points in
    your direction, indicating the most direct feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving
    before it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it
    disappears.<br>
    The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not
    to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while
    the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on her own devices to locate
    you.<br>
    If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that
    creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.<br>
    If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles,
    it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.<br>
    The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot
    engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can't
    pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5 miles
    from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.<br>

    You bring forth a great feast, including a magnificent table, chairs, service, and food and drink. The feast takes 1
    hour to consume, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over. Every creature partaking of the
    feast is cured of all diseases, sickness, and nausea; becomes immune to poison for 12 hours; and gains 1d8 temporary
    hit points +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10) after imbibing the nectar-like beverage that is part of the
    feast. The ambrosial food that is consumed grants each creature that partakes a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and
    Will saves and immunity to fear effects for 12 hours.<br>
    If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and all effects of the spell are negated.<br>

    Animals cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities,

    Undead cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities,
    such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Nonintelligent
    undead creatures are automatically affected and act as though the warded creatures are not there. An intelligent
    undead creature gets a single Will saving throw. If it fails, the subject can't see any of the warded creatures.
    However, if it has reason to believe unseen opponents are present, it can attempt to find or strike them. If a
    warded creature attempts to turn or command undead, touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature (even with a
    spell), the spell ends for all recipients.<br>

    This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling
    prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the spell ends, it can
    act normally.<br>
    A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is not affected. A creature whose type is different from the
    caster's receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn't &#147;translate&#148; well.<br>

    The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions,
    even speech. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. (This is a

    A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells
    cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become blinded when they strike the subjects. This abjuration
    has four effects.<br>
    First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike
    <I>protection from evil</I>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil
    creatures.<br>
    Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.<br>
    Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as <I>protection from evil </I>does.<br>
    Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is blinded
    (Fortitude save negates, as <I>blindness/deafness</I>, but against <I>holy aura's </I>save DC).<br>

    You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good
    creatures are unaffected.<br>
    The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to each evil creature in the area (or 1d6
    points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider) and causes it to become blinded for 1 round. A
    successful Will saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinded effect.<br>
    The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither good nor evil, and they are not blinded. Such a
    creature can reduce that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.<br>

    <B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
    This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts
    as a <I>+5 holy weapon </I>(+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against evil
    opponents). It also emits a <I>magic circle against evil </I>effect (as the spell). If the <I>magic circle </I>ends,
    the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the
    weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one <I>holy sword </I>at a time.<br>
    If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has,
    rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This
    spell is not cumulative with <I>bless weapon </I>or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way.<br>
    This spell does not work on artifacts.<br>
    <I>Note: </I>A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.<br>

    A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the air, fascinating creatures within it. Roll 2d4 and
    add your caster level (maximum 10) to determine the total number of Hit Dice of creatures affected. Creatures with
    the fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of
    origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Affected creatures
    become fascinated by the pattern of colors. Sightless creatures are not affected.<br>

    Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures, causing them to stop and stare blankly at you. In
    addition, you can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible. Roll 2d4 to
    see how many total Hit Dice of creatures you affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more
    HD. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you to be
    fascinated.<br>
    If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw. If the spell affects only a

    While the subject is fascinated by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude. This
    allows you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The request
    must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only
    with respect to that particular request.<br>
    A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it.<br>

    <B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
    You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The <I>illusory
        script </I>appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you
    at the time of the casting are able to read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character, although an
    illusionist recognizes it as <I>illusory script.<br>
    </I>Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving
    throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure
    means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell
    was cast. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes. Typical suggestions include &#147;Close the book and leave,&#148;
    &#147;Forget the existence of the book,&#148; and so forth. If successfully dispelled by <I>dispel magic, </I>the
    <I>illusory script </I>and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the
    <I>true seeing </I>spell with the <I>read magic </I>or <I>comprehend languages </I>spell.<br>
    The casting time depends on how long a message you wish to write, but it is always at least 1 minute.<br>

    This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface. It appears absolutely real when
    viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or
    normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a probing search reveals the
    true nature of the surface, though such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear.<br>

    When you cast <I>imprisonment </I>and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the
    <I>temporal stasis </I>spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The subject remains there
    unless a <I>freedom </I>spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a
    <I>crystal ball, </I>a <I>locate object </I>spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a
    creature is imprisoned, but <I>discern location </I>does. A <I>wish </I>or <I>miracle </I>spell will not free the
    recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the

    <B>Saving Throw:</B> Reflex half; see text<br>
    <B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
    An <I>incendiary cloud </I>spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot through with white-hot embers. The smoke
    obscures all sight as a <I>fog cloud </I>does. In addition, the white-hot embers within the cloud deal 4d6 points of
    fire damage to everything within the cloud on your turn each round. All targets can make Reflex saves each round to
    take half damage.<br>
    As with a <I>cloudkill </I>spell, the smoke moves away from you at 10 feet per round. Figure out the smoke's new
    spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from where you were when you cast
    the spell. By concentrating, you can make the cloud (actually its point of origin) move as much as 60 feet each
    round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the
    remainder's spread thereafter.<br>
    As with <I>fog cloud</I>, wind disperses the smoke, and the spell can't be cast underwater.<br>

    You summon a number of swarms of locusts (one per three levels, to a maximum of six swarms at 18th level). The
    swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one
    contiguous area). You may summon the locust swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm
    attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after being summoned, and won't pursue creatures
    that flee.<br>

    You call some nonliving item from virtually any location directly to your hand.<br>
    First, you must place your <I>arcane mark</I> on the item. Then you cast this spell, which magically and invisibly
    inscribes the name of the item on a sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp. Thereafter, you can summon the item by
    speaking a special word (set by you when the spell is cast) and crushing the gem. The item appears instantly in your
    hand. Only you can use the gem in this way.<br>
    If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, but you know who the possessor is and
    roughly where that creature is located when the summons occurs.<br>
    The inscription on the gem is invisible. It is also unreadable, except by means of a <I>read magic </I>spell, to
    anyone but you.<br>
    The item can be summoned from another plane, but only if no other creature has claimed ownership of it.<br>

    <I>Interposing hand </I>creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating,
    disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries
    to get around it, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand&#151;it sticks
    with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or
    disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.<br>
    An <I>interposing hand </I>is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit
    points as you do when you're undamaged, and its AC is 20 (&#150;1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal
    creature, but most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it.<br>
    The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. It cannot push through a <I>wall of force </I>or
    enter an <I>antimagic field</I>, but it suffers the full effect of a <I>prismatic wall </I>or <I>prismatic sphere.
    </I>The hand makes saving throws as its caster.<br>
    <I>Disintegrate </I>or a successful <I>dispel magic </I>destroys it.<br>
    Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The
    hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature's
    attacks.<br>
    Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.<br>

    The hand pursues and pushes away the opponent that you designate. Treat this attack as a bull rush with a +14 bonus
    on the Strength check (+8 for Strength 27, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets).
    The hand always moves with the opponent to push that target back the full distance allowed, and it has no speed
    limit. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.<br>
    A very strong creature could not push the hand out of its way because the latter would instantly reposition itself
    between the creature and you, but an opponent could push the hand up against you by successfully bull rushing
    it.<br>
    Grasping Hand<br>
    Evocation [Force]<br>
    <B>At Higher Level:</B> 7<br>
    The hand can also grapple one opponent that you select. The hand gets one grapple attack per round.<br>
    Its attack bonus to make contact equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, +10 for
    the hand's Strength score (31), &#150;1 for being Large. Its grapple bonus is this same figure, except with a +4
    modifier for being Large instead of &#150;1. The hand holds but does not harm creatures it grapples.<br>
    Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.<br>
    The hand can also bull rush an opponent, but at a +16 bonus on the Strength check (+10 for Strength 35, +4 for being
    Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets), or interpose itself.<br>
    <B>At Higher Level:</B> 8<br>
    The hand can interpose itself, push, or strike one opponent that you select. The floating hand can move as far as 60
    feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible
    or concealed creatures is no better than yours.<br>
    The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or
    Charisma modifier, +11 for the hand's Strength score (33), &#150;1 for being Large. The hand deals 1d8+11 points of
    damage on each attack, and any creature struck must make a Fortitude save (against this spell's save DC) or be
    stunned for 1 round. Directing the spell to a new target is a free interaction.<br>
    The <I>clenched fist </I>can also interpose itself as <I>interposing hand </I>does, or it can bull rush an opponent
    as <I>forceful hand </I>does, but at a +15 bonus on the Strength check.<br>
    <B>At Higher Level:</B> 9<br>

    Large. The hand deals 2d6+12 points of damage (lethal, not nonlethal) on each successful grapple check against an
    opponent.<br>
    The <I>crushing hand </I>can also interpose itself as <I>interposing hand </I>does, or it can bull rush an opponent

    The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a
    creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can
    see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.<br>
    Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the
    clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can
    become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries
    but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.<br>
    Of course, the subject is not magically <I>silenced, </I>and certain other conditions can render the recipient
    detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this
    spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe
    depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell.
    Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon
    monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger
    traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it
    immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as <I>bless </I>that specifically affect allies but
    not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.<br>
    <I>Invisibility </I>can be made permanent (on objects only) with a <I>permanency </I>spell.<br>

    This spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. The center of the effect is
    mobile with the recipient.<br>
    Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature
    moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become
    invisible. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If
    the spell recipient attacks, the spell ends.<br>

    The effect is mobile with the group and is broken when anyone in the group attacks. Individuals in the group cannot
    see each other. The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest member of the
    group. (If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both
    are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 180 feet.)<br>

    This spell transforms your body into living iron, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities.<br>
    You gain damage reduction 15/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness,
    disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or
    respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage
    from acid and fire of all kinds. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron
    golems.<br>
    You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a &#150;6 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a
    minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of
    50% and a &#150;8 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus
    can't use potions) or play wind instruments.<br>
    Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium
    characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.<br>
    Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the
    crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean&#151;at least until the spell duration expires.<br>

    <I>Ironwood </I>is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While remaining natural wood in almost

    not function on <I>ironwood</I>. Spells that affect wood do affect <I>ironwood</I>, although <I>ironwood </I>does
    not burn. Using this spell with <I>wood shape </I>or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that
    function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their
    normal steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids.<br>
    Further, if you make only half as much <I>ironwood </I>as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or
    suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.<br>

    The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete with foot shuffling and tapping. The

    imposes a &#150;4 penalty to Armor Class and a &#150;10 penalty on Reflex saves, and it negates any AC bonus granted

    This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles
    the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19&#150;20, a threat range of 19&#150;20 becomes
    17&#150;20, and a threat range of 18&#150;20 becomes 15&#150;20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing
    weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the <I>keen edge </I>on a particular projectile ends after one use,
    whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. (Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons,
    for the purpose of this spell.)<br>
    Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range (such as the <I>keen edge </I>spell and the Improved Critical
    feat) don't stack. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.<br>

    The <I>knock </I>spell opens stuck, barred, locked, <I>held, </I>or <I>arcane locked </I>doors. It opens secret
    doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they
    serve to hold closures shut). If used to open a <I>arcane locked </I>door, the spell does not remove the <I>arcane
        lock </I>but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself
    or become stuck again on its own. <I>Knock </I>does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a
    portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each spell can undo

    <I>Legend lore </I>brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is
    at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4x10 minutes. If you have only detailed
    information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete
    and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus
    allowing a better <I>legend lore </I>result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and
    the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing

    During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When
    completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be
    legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally
    known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb,
    characters who are 11th level and higher are &#147;legendary,&#148; as are the sorts of creatures they contend with,
    the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.<br>

    a vision about it by succeeding on a caster level check (1d20 +1 per caster level) against DC 20. If only detailed
    information on the person, place, or object is known, the DC is 25, and the information gained is incomplete. If

    <I>Levitate </I>allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must
    be willing to be <I>levitated, </I>and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can
    mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You
    cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or
    push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).<br>
    A <I>levitating </I>creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the

    Lightning Bolt<br>
    Evocation [Electricity]<br>
    <B>Level:</B> 3<br>
    <B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
    <B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
    <B>Range:</B> 120 ft.<br>
    <B>Area:</B> 120-ft. line<br>
    <B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
    <B>Saving Throw:</B> Reflex half<br>
    <B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
    You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level
    (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips.<br>
    The <I>lightning bolt </I>sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low
    melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier
    shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it
    stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.<br>

    Limited Wish<br>
    Universal<br>
    <B>Level:</B> 7<br>
    <B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>

    A <I>limited wish </I>lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a <I>limited wish </I>can do any of
    the following things.<br>
    &#149; Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited
    to you.<br>
    &#149; Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.<br>
    &#149; Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.<br>
    &#149; Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.<br>
    &#149; Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as <I>geas/quest </I>or <I>insanity</I>.<br>
    &#149; Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature
    automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a &#150;7 penalty on its next saving throw.<br>
    A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal (but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell).
    When a <I>limited wish </I>spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you
    must provide that component.<br>
    <I>Material component: </I>A diamond worth at least 1,500 gp.<br>

    Liveoak<br>
    Transmutation<br>

    <B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
    <B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
    <B>Target:</B> Tree touched<br>

    <B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
    <B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
    This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can be cast on only a single tree at a time;
    while <I>liveoak </I>is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree. The tree on which the spell is cast must
    be within 10 feet of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 300 feet of something that you
    wish to guard or protect.<br>
    <I>Liveoak </I>must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed
    on the targeted oak. The <I>liveoak </I>spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant. <br>
    If <I>liveoak </I>is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately, wherever it happens to be. If released by you, the
    tree tries to return to its original location before taking root.<br>

    <B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
    <B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
    <B>Range:</B> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft. per caster level)<br>
    <B>Area:</B> Circle, centered on you, with a radius of 400 ft. + 40 ft. per caster level<br>

    <B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>

    You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. You can search for general items, in which
    case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item
    requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell
    fails. You cannot specify a unique item unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through
    divination).<br>
    The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell. <I>Polymorph any object
    </I>fools it.<br>
    <B>At Higher Level:</B> 4<br>
    <B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
    <B>Duration:</B> 10 min. per caster level<br>
    This spell locates a known or familiar creature.<br>
    You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within
    range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any.<br>
    The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of
    a certain type. To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least
    once.<br>
    Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by <I>mislead</I>, <I>nondetection</I>,
    and <I>polymorph </I>spells.<br>

    <B>Target:</B> You<br>
    <B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level (D)<br>
    This spell increases your base land speed by 10 feet. (This adjustment counts as an enhancement bonus.) It has no
    effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim.<br>

    <B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
    <B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
    Any creature within the area that fails a Will save becomes drowsy and inattentive, getting disadvantage on
    Perception checks and a &#150;2 penalty on Will saves against <I>sleep </I>effects while the <I>lullaby </I>is in
    effect. <I>Lullaby </I>lasts for as long as the caster concentrates, plus up to 1 round per caster level
    thereafter.<br>
