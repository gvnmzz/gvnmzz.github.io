Mage Armor<br>
Conjuration (Creation) [Force]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a <I>mage armor </I>spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to AC.<br>
Unlike mundane armor, <I>mage armor </I>entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since <I>mage armor </I>is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.<br>
<br>
Mage Hand<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B>0<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One nonmagical, unattended object weighing up to 5 lb.<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Concentration<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You point your finger at an object and can lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, you can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spell's range.<br>
<br>
Mage's Disjunction<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Level: </B> 9<br>
<B>Components:</B> V<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Area:</B> All magical effects and magic items within a 40-ft.-radius burst<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a <I>dispel magic </I>spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever is higher.<br>
You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an <I>antimagic field. </I>If the <I>antimagic field </I>survives the <I>disjunction, </I>no items within it are disjoined.<br>
Even artifacts are subject to <I>disjunction, </I>though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. (These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even <I>miracle </I>or <I>wish</I>.)<br>
<I>Note: </I>Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.<br>
<br>
Mage's Faithful Hound<br>
Conjuration (Creation)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Phantom watchdog<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour/caster level or until discharged, then 1 round/caster level; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move). The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions.<br>
If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature.<br>
The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.<br>
The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends.<br>
<br>
Mage's Lucubration<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level: </B>6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
You instantly recall any one spell of 5th level or lower that you have used during the past 24 hours. The spell must have been actually cast during that period. The recalled spell is stored in your mind as through prepared in the normal fashion.<br>
If the recalled spell requires material components, you must provide them. The recovered spell is not usable until the material components are available.<br>
<br>
Mage's Magnificent Mansion<br>
Conjuration (Creation)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> Extradimensional mansion, up to three 10-ft. cubes per caster level (S)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 2 hours per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.<br>
You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as <I>unseen servant </I>spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.<br>
Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.<br>
<I>Focus: </I>A miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon (each item worth 5 gp).<br>
<br>
Mage's Private Sanctum<br>
Abjuration<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Area:</B> 30-ft. cube per caster level (S)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 24 hours (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from outside sees only a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. No sounds, no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from outside. Those inside can see out normally.<br>
Divination (scrying) spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to <I>detect thoughts</I>. The ward prevents speech between those inside and those outside (because it blocks sound), but it does not prevent other communication, such as a <I>sending </I>or <I>message </I>spell, or telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and her familiar.<br>
The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area.<br>
<I>Mage's private sanctum </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell.<br>
<br>
Mage's Sword<br>
Evocation [Force]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 7<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Effect:</B> One sword<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
This spell brings into being a shimmering, swordlike plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once each round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Int bonus or your Cha bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19&#150;20 and a critical multiplier of x2.<br>
The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns to you and hovers.<br>
Each round after the first, you can use a action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round's target.<br>
The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <I>dispel magic</I>, <I>disintegrate</I>, a <I>sphere of annihilation</I>, or a <I>rod of cancellation </I>affects it. The sword's AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).<br>
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time <I>Mage's sword </I>strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.<br>
<I>Focus: </I>A miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc. It costs 250 gp to construct.<br>
<br>
Magic Aura<br>
Illusion (Glamer)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> One touched object weighing up<br>
to 5 lb. per caster level<br>
<B>Duration:</B> One day per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You alter an item's aura so that it registers to <I>detect </I>spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. <br>
If the object bearing <I>magic aura </I>has <I>identify </I>cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is.<br>
If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), <I>magic aura </I>doesn't work.<br>
<I>Note: </I>A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.<br>
<br>
Magic Circle<br>
Abjuration [Good or Evil or Lawful or Chaotic]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Area:</B> 10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No; see text<br>
All creatures within the area gain the effects of a <I>protection </I>spell, and no summoned creatures with alignment different from that chosen for the <I>protection </I>spell can enter the area either. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of <I>protection</I>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.<br>
This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <I>magic circle</I>can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a called creature (such as those called by the <I>lesser planar binding, planar binding, </I>and <I>greater planar binding </I>spells) with alignment different from that chosen from this spell for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <I>magic circle</I>. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <I>protection</I> spell for that creature only.<br>
A <I>magic circle </I>leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<I>astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, </I>and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a <I>dimensional anchor </I>spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <I>anchor </I>effect lasts as long as the <I>magic circle </I>does. The creature cannot reach across the <I>magic circle, </I>but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.<br>
You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <I>magic circle </I>more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.<br>
A successful diagram allows you to cast a <I>dimensional anchor </I>spell on the <I>magic circle </I>during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <I>anchor </I>holds any called creatures in the <I>magic circle </I>for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <I>magic circle </I>prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <I>lesser planar binding </I>spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram&#151;even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.<br>
This spell is not cumulative with <I>protection </I>and vice versa.<br>
<I>Arcane Material Component: </I>A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-footdiameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.<br>
<br>
Magic Fang<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, DF<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Living creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
<I>Magic fang </I>gives one natural weapon of the subject a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The spell can affect a slam attack, fist, bite, or other natural weapon. 
<I>Magic fang </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level<br>
The enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5).<br>
Alternatively, you may imbue all of the creature's natural weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus (regardless of your caster level).<br>
<I>Greater magic fang </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell.<br>
<br>
Magic Jar<br>
Necromancy<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level or until you return to your body<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
By casting <I>magic jar, </I>you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (known as the <I>magic jar</I>), leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the <I>magic jar. </I>You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.<br>
To cast the spell, the <I>magic jar </I>must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead. <br>
While in the <I>magic jar, </I>you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)<br>
You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.<br>
Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by <I>protection from evil </I>or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the <I>magic jar </I>unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the <I>magic jar, </I>and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.<br>
If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the <I>magic jar. </I>You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.<br>
As a action, you can shift freely from a host to the <I>magic jar </I>if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.<br>
If the host body is slain, you return to the <I>magic jar, </I>if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.<br>
If the spell ends while you are in the <I>magic jar, </I>you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the <I>magic jar </I>returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the <I>magic jar </I>or at the host's location.<br>
<I>Focus: </I>A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp.<br>
<br>
Magic Missile<br>
Evocation [Force]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to five creatures, no two of which can be more than 15 ft. apart<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.<br>
The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out. Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.<br>
For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile&#151;two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.<br>
<br>
Magic Mouth<br>
Illusion (Glamer)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, M<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature or object<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent until discharged<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (object)<br>
This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, <I>magic mouth </I>can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.<br>
The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical <I>darkness </I>or <I>invisibility </I>does. Silent movement or magical <I>silence </I>defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A <I>magic mouth </I>cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.<br>
The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a <I>magic mouth </I>to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.<br>
<I>Magic mouth </I>can be made permanent with a <I>permanency </I>spell.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>A small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth 10 gp.<br>

Magic Stone<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Targets:</B> Up to three pebbles touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 30 minutes or until discharged<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless, object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless, object)<br>
You transmute as many as three pebbles, which can be no larger than sling bullets, so that they strike with great force when thrown or slung. If hurled, they have a range increment of 20 feet. If slung, treat them as sling bullets (range increment 50 feet). The spell gives them a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The user of the stones makes a normal ranged attack<I>. </I>Each stone that hits deals 1d6+1 points of damage (including the spell's enhancement bonus), or 2d6+2 points against undead.<br>
<br>
Magic Vestment<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Armor or shield touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless, object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless, object)<br>
You imbue a suit of armor or a shield with an enhancement bonus of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).<br>
An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell.<br>
<br>
Magic Weapon<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target: </B>Weapon touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless, object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless, object)<br>
<I>Magic weapon </I>gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. (An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.)<br>
You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see <I>magic fang</I>). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One weapon or fifty projectiles (all of which must be in contact with each other at the time of casting)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level<br>
This spell gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5).<br>
Alternatively, you can affect as many as fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation when used. (Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.)<br>

Necromancy<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 10 minutes<br>
<B>Range:</B> Touch<br>
<B>Target:</B> Creature touched<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You draw an indelible mark on the subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of criminal behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the effect of <I>bestow curse</I>.<br>
Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can cast it only on a creature that is willing or restrained.<br>
Like the effect of <I>bestow curse</I>, a <I>mark of justice </I>cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a <I>break enchantment</I>, <I>limited wish</I>, <I>miracle</I>, <I>remove curse</I>, or <I>wish </I>spell. <I>Remove curse </I>works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than your <I>mark of justice </I>caster level. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the mark has activated.<br>

Maze<br>

<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> See text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, forcing the subject to leave.<br>
On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the <I>maze </I>spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as <I>teleport </I>and <I>dimension door, </I>do not help a creature escape a <I>maze </I>spell, although a <I>plane shift </I>spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.<br>

Meld into Stone<br>
Transmutation [Earth]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 10 min. per caster level<br>
<I>Meld into stone </I>enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.<br>
While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save.<br>
Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.<br>
The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying: <I>Stone to flesh </I>expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. <I>Stone shape </I>deals you 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. <I>Transmute rock to mud </I>expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled. Finally, <I>passwall </I>expels you without damage.<br>

Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by <I>mending. </I>The spell can repair a magic item, but the item's magical abilities are not restored.

The spell completely repairs an object made of any substance, even one with multiple breaks, to be as strong as new. The spell does not restore the magical abilities of a broken magic item made whole, and it cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands. The spell does not repair items that have been warped, burned, disintegrated, ground to powder, melted, or vaporized, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs).<br>

You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies with little chance of being overheard. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical <I>silence, </I>1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It doesn't transcend language barriers.<br>
<I>Note: </I>To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper, possibly allowing observers the opportunity to read your lips.<br>

Meteor Swarm<br>
Evocation [Fire]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 9<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Area:</B> Four 40-ft.-radius spreads; see text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None or Reflex half; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
<I>Meteor swarm </I>is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to <I>fireball </I>in many aspects. When you cast it, four 2- foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.<br>
If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor. Any creature struck by one of these spheres takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and receives no saving throw against the sphere's fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target's space. You may aim more than one meteor at the same target.<br>
Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each. (Fire resistance applies to each sphere's damage individually.)<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 24 hours<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless)<br>
The subject is protected from all devices and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. <I>Mind blank </I>even foils <I>limited wish</I>, <I>miracle</I>, and <I>wish </I>spells when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject's mind or to gain information about it. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as <I>arcane eye, </I>the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.<br>
<br>
Mind Fog<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 30 minutes and 2d6 rounds; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
<I>Mind fog </I>produces a bank of thin mist that weakens the mental resistance of those caught in it. Creatures in the <I>mind fog </I>take a &#150;10 competence penalty on Wisdom checks and Will saves. (A creature that successfully saves against the fog is not affected and need not make further saves even if it remains in the fog.) Affected creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 30 minutes (or until dispersed by wind).<br>
A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in four rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.<br>
The fog is thin and does not significantly hamper vision.<br>

You create a nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving, vegetable matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. You must succeed on an appropriate skill check to make a complex item.<br>
Attempting to use any created object as a material component causes the spell to fail.<br>

<B>Range:</B> See text<br>
<B>Target, Effect, or Area: </B>See text<br>
<B>Duration:</B> See text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> See text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You don't so much cast a <I>miracle </I>as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.<br>
A <I>miracle </I>can do any of the following things.<br>
&#149; Duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower.<br>
&#149; Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as <I>feeblemind </I>or <I>insanity</I>.<br>
&#149; Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.<br>
If the <I>miracle </I>has any of the above effects, casting it has Material component.<br>
Alternatively, you can make a very powerful request. Casting such a <I>miracle </I>costs 25,000 XP in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful <I>miracles </I>of this sort could include the following.<br>
&#149; Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.<br>
&#149; Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.<br>
&#149; Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.<br>
In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.<br>
A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a <I>miracle </I>duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost. When a <I>miracle </I>spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.<br>
<I>Material component: </I>25,000 gp in powdered diamond (for some uses of the <I>miracle </I>spell; see above).<br>

Mirror Image<br>
Illusion (Figment)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal; see text<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 min. per caster level (D)<br>
Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck.<br>
<I>Mirror image </I>creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total). These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a <I>mirror image. </I>When you and the <I>mirror image </I>separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.<br>
Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An image's AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being hit by a <I>fireball</I>).<br>
While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded.<br>
An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded.)<br>
<br>
Misdirection<br>
Illusion (Glamer)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 2<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One creature or object, up to a 10-ft. cube in size<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None or Will negates; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras (<I>detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, </I>and the like). On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of <I>misdirection </I>is detected as if it were the other object. (Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect.) Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (<I>augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, </I>and the like).<br>
<br>
Mislead<br>
Illusion (Figment, Glamer)<br>
<B>Level:</B>6<br>
<B>Components:</B> S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target/Effect:</B> You/one illusory double<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 round per caster level (D) and concentration + 3 rounds; see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None or Will disbelief (if interacted with); see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You become invisible (as <I>improved invisibility</I>, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (as <I>major image, </I>a figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.<br>
The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The <I>improved invisibility </I>lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.<br>
<br>
Modify Memory<br>
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 5<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 round; see text<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> One living creature<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Permanent<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.<br>
&#149; Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot negate <I>charm, geas/quest, suggestion, </I>or similar spells.<br>
&#149; Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced.<br>
&#149; Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.<br>
&#149; Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.<br>
Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost.<br>
A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine. <br>
<br>
Moment of Prescience<br>
Divination<br>
<B>Level:</B> 8<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Personal<br>
<B>Target:</B> You<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 1 hour per caster level or until discharged<br>
This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself. Once during the spell's duration, you may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack (even if flatfooted). Activating the effect doesn't take an action; you can even activate it on another character's turn if needed. You must choose to use the <I>moment of prescience </I>before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends.<br>
<br>
Mount<br>

<B>Effect:</B> One mount<br>
<B>Duration:</B> 2 hours per caster level (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
You summon a light horse or a pony (your choice) to serve you as a mount. The steed serves willingly and well. The mount comes with a bit and bridle and a riding saddle.<br>
<br>
Move Earth<br>
Transmutation [Earth]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 6<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> See text<br>
<B>Range:</B> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Area:</B> Dirt in an area up to 750 ft. square and up to 10 ft. deep (S)<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw:</B> None<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> No<br>
<I>Move earth </I>moves dirt (clay, loam, sand), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth.<br>
However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.<br>
This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.<br>
The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle.<br>
This spell has no effect on earth creatures.<br>
<br>
Neutralize Poison<br>
Conjuration (Healing)<br>
<B>Level:</B> 3<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 10 min. per caster level<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (harmless, object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (harmless, object)<br>
You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own.<br>
The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell. Unlike with <I>delay poison</I>, such effects aren't postponed until after the duration &#151;the creature need not make any saves against poison effects applied to it during the length of the spell.<br>
This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for the duration of the spell, at the caster's option.<br>

You send a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to a specific creature that you name or otherwise specifically designate.<br>
The <I>nightmare </I>prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The <I>nightmare </I>leaves the subject fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours.<br>
The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.<br>

<I>Dispel evil </I>cast on the subject while you are casting the spell dispels the <I>nightmare </I>and causes you to be stunned for 10 minutes per caster level of the <I>dispel evil</I>.<br>
If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting. If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell or the spell ends.<br>
If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance.<br>
You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance. (You always fail any saving throw, for example.)<br>
Creatures who don't sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or dream are immune to this spell.<br>

Nondetection<br>
Abjuration<br>

The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as <I>clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, </I>and <I>detect </I>spells. <I>Nondetection </I>also prevents location by such magic items as <I>crystal ball</I>s. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast <I>nondetection</I>. If you cast <I>nondetection </I>on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.<br>
If cast on a creature, <I>nondetection </I>wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.<br>
<I>Material Component: </I>A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 gp.<br>

<B>Duration:</B> 8 hours (D)<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (object)<br>
This spell hides an object from location by divination (scrying) effects, such as the <I>scrying </I>spell or a <I>crystal ball</I>. Such an attempt automatically fails (if the divination is targeted on the object) or fails to perceive the object (if the divination is targeted on a nearby location, object, or person).<br>
<br>
Obscuring Mist<br>

<B>Level:</B> 1<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>

A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).<br>
A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a <I>gust of wind </I>spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A <I>fireball, flame strike</I>, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A <I>wall of fire </I>burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.<br>
This spell does not function underwater.<br>

Open/Close<br>
Transmutation<br>
<B>Level:</B> 0<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S, F<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range:</B> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels)<br>
<B>Target:</B> Object weighing up to 30 lb. or portal that can be opened or closed<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will negates (object)<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes (object)<br>
You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell's ability to affect.<br>
<br>
Order's Wrath<br>
Evocation [Lawful]<br>
<B>Level:</B> 4<br>
<B>Components:</B> V, S<br>
<B>Casting Time:</B> 1 action<br>
<B>Range: </B>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level)<br>
<B>Area:</B> Nonlawful creatures within a burst that fills a 30-ft. cube<br>
<B>Duration:</B> Instantaneous (1 round); see text<br>
<B>Saving Throw: </B>Will partial; see text<br>
<B>Spell Resistance:</B> Yes<br>
You channel lawful power to smite enemies. The power takes the form of a three-dimensional grid of energy. Only chaotic and neutral (not lawful) creatures are harmed by the spell.<br>
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to chaotic creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to chaotic outsiders) and causes them to be dazed for 1 round. A successful Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the daze effect.<br>
The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not dazed. They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.<br>

The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, adding the usual benefit to Wisdom-related skills. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters) who receive <I>owl's wisdom </I>do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Wisdom, but the save DCs for their spells increase.<br>
<B>At Higher Level:</B> 6<br>
