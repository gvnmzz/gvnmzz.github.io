        <b>Skills:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dominate Person (Sp) DC 17 (3/day):</b> You can control the actions of any humanoid creature
        through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind. If you and the subject have a common
        language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If
        no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Slime (Ex) DC 19 (On Hit):</b> A blow from an aboleth's tentacle can cause a terrible
        transformation. A creature hit by a tentacle must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or begin to turn into a
        slimy, translucent substance. The affected creature must be kept moist with cool, fresh water or take 1d12
        points of damage every 10 minutes. The slime reduces the creature's natural armor bonus by 1 (but never to less
        than +0).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mucus Cloud (Ex) DC 19 (Constant):</b> An aboleth underwater surrounds itself with a viscous
        cloud of
        mucus roughly 1 foot thick. Any creature coming into contact with and inhaling this substance must succeed on a
        DC 19 Fortitude save or lose the ability to breathe air for the next 3 hours. An affected creature suffocates in
        2d6 minutes if removed from the water. Renewed contact with the mucus cloud and failing another save extends the
        duration by another 3 hours.<br>
        <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Black Cloud (Ex) DC 15 (3/day):</b> Up to three times per day an achaierai can release a choking,
        toxic black cloud. Those within 10 feet of the achaierai take 2d6 points of damage. They must also succeed on a
        DC 15 Fortitude save or be affected for 3 hours as though by an <i>insanity</i> spell. An achaierai is immune to
        the effects of its own black cloud.<br>

        <b>Skills:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Babble (Su) DC 16 (Constant):</b> An allip constantly mutters and whines to itself, creating a
        hypnotic effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of the allip must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be affected
        as though by a <i>hypnotism</i> spell for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madness (Su) (Constant):</b> Anyone targeting an allip with a thought-detection, mind-control,
        or telepathic ability makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Wisdom Drain (Su) (On Hit):</b> An allip causes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain each time it hits
        with its incorporeal touch attack. On each such successful attack, it gains 5 temporary hit points.<br>

        this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20
        feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a <i>lesser globe of
            invulnerability</i>, both with a radius of 20 feet.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stun (Su) DC 22 (On Hit):</b> If an angel strikes an opponent twice in one round with its mace,
        that

        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hardness (Ex) (Constant):</b> An animated object has hardness based on the material it is made of
        (e.g., Wood 5, Stone 8, Metal 10).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Construct Traits (Ex) (Constant):</b> Animated objects are immune to mind-affecting effects,
        poison, sleep
        effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and necromancy effects. They cannot heal damage on their
        own, but often can be repaired. They are not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability
        drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. They are immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude save
        (unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless).<br>
        <br>

        <font size="4">ANKHEG</font><br>
        <b>CR:</b> 3<br>

        <b>Skills:</b><br>

        14

        during a bite while its acid is depleted.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Improved Grab (Ex) (On Hit):</b> To use this ability, an ankheg must hit with its bite attack. It
        can
        then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the ankheg is
        damaged after grabbing its prey, it retreats backward down its tunnel at its burrow speed, dragging the victim
        with it.<br>

        <b>Skills:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Web (Ex) DC 13 (6/day):</b> In spider or hybrid form (see below), an aranea can throw a web up to
        six times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range
        increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of up to Large size. The web anchors the target in place,
        allowing no movement. An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a
        DC 13 Strength check.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Poison (Ex) DC 13 (On Hit):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage
        2d6
        Str.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Spells (Sp) (Constant):</b> An aranea casts spells as a 3rd-level sorcerer. It prefers illusions
        and enchantments
        and avoids fire spells.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Change Shape (Su) (At will):</b> An aranea's natural form is that of a Medium monstrous spider.
        It can assume two other forms. The first is a unique Small or Medium humanoid; an aranea always assumes the same
        appearance and traits in humanoid form. The second form is a Medium spider-humanoid hybrid. In humanoid form,
        the aranea cannot use its bite attack, webs, or poison.<br>
        <br>

        <b>Skills:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Aura of Menace (Su) DC Varies (Constant):</b> A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or
        get angry.
        Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The
        save DC varies with the type of archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a
        -2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon. A creature that has
        resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon's aura for 24 hours.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Magic Circle against Evil (Su) (Constant):</b> A <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect always
        surrounds an archon. (The defensive benefits from the circle are not

        (caster level 14th), except that the creature can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Change Shape (Su) (At will):</b> A hound archon can assume any canine form of Small to Large
        size. While in canine form, the hound archon loses its bite, slam, and greatsword attacks, but gains the bite
        attack of the form it chooses. For the purposes of this ability, canines include any doglike creature of the
        animal type.<br>
        <br>

        as a
        free action (Ref DC 13 partial). The effect lasts until the vine dies or decides to end it (also a free action).
        The ability is otherwise similar to <i>entangle</i>.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Camouflage (Ex) (Constant):</b> Since an assassin vine looks like a normal plant when at rest, it
        takes
        a DC 20 Spot check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use
        one of those skills instead of Spot to notice the plant.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lay on Hands (Su) (1/day):</b> As the paladin class feature, except that each day, an avoral
        can heal an amount of damage equal to its full normal hit points.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>True Seeing (Su) (Constant):</b> This ability is identical with <i>true seeing</i>
        14th), except that it has personal range and the avoral must concentrate for 1 full round before it takes
        effect. Thereafter the ability remains in effect as long as the avoral concentrates on it.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fear Aura (Su) DC 17 (1/day):</b> Once per day an avoral can create an aura of fear in a 20-foot
        radius. It is otherwise identical with <i>fear</i> from an 8th-level caster (save DC 17).<br>

        <b>Skills:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Heat (Ex) (Constant):</b> An azer's body is intensely hot, so its unarmed attacks deal extra fire
        damage (1 point). Its metallic weapons also conduct this heat.<br>
        <br>

        The save DCs are Charisma-based.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Feed (Su) (At will):</b> When a barghest slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse,
        devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any
        form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Change Shape (Su) (At will):</b> A barghest can assume the shape of a goblin or a wolf as a
        standard action. In goblin form, a barghest cannot use its natural weapons but can wield weapons and wear armor.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Blindsight (Ex) (Constant):</b> Grimlocks can ascertain all foes within 40 feet as a sighted
        creature would. Beyond that range, they treat all targets as having total concealment. Grimlocks are susceptible
        to sound- and scent-based attacks, however, and are affected normally by loud noises and sonic spells (such as
        <i>ghost sound</i> or <i>silence</i>) and overpowering odors (such as <i>stinking cloud</i> or
        <i>cloudkill</i>). Negating a grimlock’s sense of smell or hearing reduces this ability to normal Blind-Fight
        (as the feat). If both these senses are negated, a grimlock is effectively blinded.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Immunities (Ex) (Constant):</b> Grimlocks are immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions,
        and other attack forms that rely on sight.<br>
