A SKILL BASED GAME<br>
</font>
<font size="3"><br>
In this game, everything a character can do is a skill. 
Most skills have varying levels of proficiency, while a few are binaryâ€”you can either perform them or you cannot.<br>
There are different types of skills: <br>
&#149; <B>Core Skills</B>: Your Ability Scores, Hit Points and Saving Throws are Core Skills.<br>
&#149; <B>Ordinary Skills</B>: Attacking with a weapon or attempting to be stealthy are ordinary skills. All ordinary skills have an associated ability.<br>
&#149; <B>Extraordinary Skills</B>: Extraordinary skills are the result of intense training or innate talent, setting individuals apart in unique ways. These abilities possess a special quality that elevates them beyond the ordinary. Some of them can increase in power as your score in that skill increases, others are just smaller feats that increase your range of options.<br>
&#149; <B>Supernatural Skills</B>: Supernatural skills are magical in nature. They may come from a mystical source, or from the power of a deity or nature itself. Some of them can increase in power as your score in that skill increases, others are just lesser supernatural powers that increase your range of options.<br>
&#149; <B>Spells</B>: Spells are magical powers and work as any other skill. They can be cast at will and depending on how good you are at casting a spell, you might or might not drain your source of power. They also have specific activation requirements, generally needing the ability to speak, move your hands, and use a tool.<br>
<br>
THE CORE MECHANIC<br>
Whenever you attempt an action that has some chance of failure, you roll a twenty-sided die (d20). To determine if your character succeeds at a task you do this:<br>
&#149; Roll a d20.<br>
&#149; Add any relevant modifiers.<br>
&#149; Compare the result to a target number.<br>
If the result equals or exceeds the target number, your character succeeds. If the result is lower than the target number, you fail.<br>
<br>
DICE<br>
Dice rolls are described with expressions such as &#147;3d4+3,&#148; which means &#147;roll three four-sided dice and add 3&#148; (resulting in a number between 6 and 15). The first number tells you how many dice to roll (adding the results together). The number immediately after the &#147;d&#148; tells you the type of die to use. Any number after that indicates a quantity that is added or subtracted from the result.<br>
<B><br>
d%:</B> Percentile dice work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before you roll) is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100.<br>
<br>
ROUNDING FRACTIONS<br>
In general, if you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the fraction is one-half or larger.<br>
<I>Exception: </I>Certain rolls, such as damage and hit points, have a minimum of 1.<br>
<br>
ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE<br>
Sometimes, you have favorable odds while rolling a d20. In these situations, where you have Advantage, you roll two d20s and take the better result. 
Conversely, when your odds are unfavorable, you have Disadvantage, where you roll two d20s and take the worse result.<br>
<br>
SKILL CHECKS<br>
Performing a skill check is one of the most common actions you'll undertake. 
You roll to attack, cast a spell, bribe someone, deceive, or see if you know something...<br>
You then add the relevant modifiers and compare the result to the target number. 
The target number varies depending on the task. For example, when attacking, you aim to hit the opponent's Armor Class. 
For most other activities, the Game Master will provide the Difficulty Class, which is the target number for your skill check.<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCE ROLLS<br>
The Experience Roll is the basic element that allows character advancement.
Each skill has an associated symbol (&#9210;...) indicating how many Experience Rolls the skill increase costs and it is variable. 
Learning or improving the skill in a weapon, for example costs (&#9210;), while learning to cast or improve your <I>fireball</I> costs (&#9210;&#9210;&#9210;).<br>
</font>

<font size="5"><br>
THE ABILITIES<br>
</font><font size="3">Each ability partially describes your character and affects some of his or her actions.<br>
<br>
STRENGTH (STR)<br> 
Strength measures your character's muscle and physical power. This ability is crucial for success in combat and determines how much equipment your character can carry.<br>
You apply your character's Strength modifier to:<br>
&#149; Melee attack rolls.<br>
&#149; Ranged attack rolls made with thrown weapons.<br>
&#149; Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon (including a sling). (<I>Exception: </I>Off-hand attacks don't add the character's Strength bonus.)<br>
&#149; Athletics checks. This is the only skill that has Strength as its key ability.<br>
&#149; Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).<br>
<br>
</font><font size="3">DEXTERITY (DEX)<br>
Dexterity measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is crucial for characters who wear light or medium armor, fight with finesse weapons, or excel in archery.
You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:<br>
&#149; Melee attack rolls made with finesse weapons.<br>
&#149; Ranged attack rolls, including those for attacks made with bows and crossbows.<br>
&#149; Damage rolls when using a finesse melee weapon or a ranged weapon. (<I>Exception: </I>Off-hand attacks don't add the character's Dexterity bonus.)<br>
&#149; Armor Class (AC).<br>
&#149; Reflex saving throws, for avoiding fireballs and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly.<br>
&#149; Acrobatics, Stealth, Sleight of Hand, Use Rope checks. These are the skills that have Dexterity as their key ability.<br>
<br>
CONSTITUTION (CON)<br>
Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points.<br>
You apply your character's Constitution modifier to:<br>
&#149; Each roll of a Hit Die (though a penalty can never drop a result below 1&#151;that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit point per Hit Die).<br>
&#149; Fortitude saving throws, for resisting poison and similar threats.<br>
If a character's Constitution score changes enough to alter his or her Constitution modifier, the character's hit points also increase or decrease accordingly.<br>
<B><br>
</B>INTELLIGENCE (INT)<br>
Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. 
This ability is important for those who study magic because it affects how hard their spells are to resist and how powerful their spells can be. 
It's also important for any character who rely on knowledge.<br>
You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:<br>
&#149; The number of languages your character knows at the start of the game.<br>
&#149; Craft, Knowledge, Spellcraft, Use Magic Device, Medicine checks. These are the skills that have Intelligence as their key ability.<br>
An animal has an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. A creature of humanlike intelligence has a score of at least 3.<br>
<B><br>
</B>WISDOM (WIS)<br>
Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While Intelligence represents one's ability to analyze information, 
Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one's surroundings. Wisdom is the most important ability for characters whose magic comes from their willpowerbecause it affects how hard their spells are to resist and how powerful their spells can be. 
If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score.<br>
You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:<br>
&#149; Will saving throws (for negating the effect of charm person and other spells).<br>
&#149; Animal Handling, Insight, Perception and Survival checks. These are the skills that have Wisdom as their key ability.<br>
<B><br>
</B>CHARISMA (CHA)<br>
Charisma measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. 
This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social setting. 
Charisma is most important for characters with innate magical power. Every creature has a Charisma score.<br>
You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:<br>
&#149; Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion and Use Magic Device checks. These are the skills that have Charisma as their key ability.<br>
&#149; Checks that represent attempts to influence others. <br>
<br>
When an ability score changes, all attributes associated with that score change accordingly.<br>
The minimum Ability score needed to cast a spell is 10 + the spell's level.<br>
</font>

<font size="5"><br>
ABILITY SCORES<br>
</font><font size="3"><br>
Each character has six ability scores that represent his character's most basic attributes. 
They are his raw talent and prowess. 
While a character rarely rolls an ability check (using just an ability score), these scores, and the modifiers they create, affect nearly every aspect of a character's skills and abilities. 
Each ability score generally ranges from 3 to 18, although racial bonuses and penalties can alter this; an average ability score is 10.<br>

<font size="4"><br>
GENERATING ABILITY SCORES<br>
</font><font size="3">
There are a number of different methods used to generate ability scores. 
Each of these methods gives a different level of flexibility and randomness to character generation.<br>
Racial modifiers (adjustments made to your ability scores due to your character's raceâ€”see Races) are applied after the scores are generated.<br>

<br><B>Standard</B>: Roll 4d6, discard the lowest die result, and add the three remaining results together. 
Record this total and repeat the process until six numbers are generated. Assign these totals to your ability scores as you see fit.<br>

<br><B>Point Buy</B>: Each character receives an extra number of experience rolls to spend on increasing their basic attributes. In this method, all attributes start at a base of 10. A character can increase an individual score by spending some of his experience rolls. This is done by means of the table Ability Score Costs.
Likewise, they can gain more experience rolls by decreasing one or more of their ability scores. No score can be reduced below 7 or raised above 18 using this method. After all the points are spent, apply any racial modifiers the character might have.<br>
<br>
The number of experience rolls you have depends on the type of campaign you are playing. The standard value for a character is 35 experience rolls. The dungeon master can increase or decrease this number as they see fit depending on the needs of the story. The purchase method emphasizes player choice and creates equally balanced characters.<br>
<br>
Any leftover points &mdash; if any &mdash; can be carried over to the pool of experience rolls for character creation. <br>

ABILITY MODIFIERS<br>
</font><font size="3">Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging from &#150;5 to +5. The ability modifier is calculated as (Ability &#150; 10) / 2, rounded down. Table: Ability Modifiers shows the modifier for each score. 
The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren't die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty.<br>
<font size="4"><br>
ABILITY POOLS AND POWER POOL<br>
</font><font size="3">
Each ability, has an associated Pool that contains as many points as the relative (positive) ability modifier. The pool cannot contain less than 0 points. The pools are used to activate special skills or to do things that would not normally be possible.<br>
There is also a special Power Pool which contains as many points as the character's spellcasting ability score - 10. The Power Pool is used specificaly to use magic skills.
<br>
The usage of a pool point depends on the specific skill, but in general if the skill is an increasable skill, you roll a d20 and if the d20 is higher than the skill score, you subtract the the skill cost from the pool points. If the d20 roll is lower than the skill score, you don't subtract anything. If the skill is a non-increasable skill, you always subtract the corresponding skill cost from the pool whenever you use the skill.
<br>
For Magic, you use the Power pool instead of the the ability pool;
<br>
<br>
For each feature you need ability pool points for, you generally expend 1 ability pool point per usage.
Let's see some examples of usage for each pool:<br>
<b> Strenght pool:</b> <br>
&#149; Make an additional attack using strength.<br>
&#149; Make a sneak attack using strength.<br>
<b> Dexterity pool:</b> <br>
&#149; Make an additional attack using dexterity.<br>
&#149; Make a sneak attack using dexterity.<br>
&#149; Make an additional dash action.<br>
<b> Constitution pool:</b> <br>
&#149; Rage.<br>
&#149; Roll another death saving throw.<br>
&#149; Roll another Hit Die.<br>
<b> Intelligence pool:</b> <br>
&#149; Reroll a knowledge skill check once.<br>
<b> Wisdom pool:</b> <br>
&#149; Wild shape.<br>
<b> Charisma pool:</b> <br>
&#149; Turn Undead.<br>
&#149; Smite.<br>
&#149; Countersong.<br>
&#149; Fascinate.<br>
&#149; Inspire.<br>
<b> Power Pool:</b> <br>
When you cast a spell and you fail the associated skill check, you use up a number of power points equal to yhe Spell Level of the spell you casted. If you failed the check and there are not enough points in the Power Pool, you fail to use use the magical skill.
