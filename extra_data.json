A trade good, in this sense, is a valuable good that can be\n    easily exchanged almost as if it were cash itself.<br>\n  </font>\n  <font size=\"5\"><br>\n    WEAPONS<br>\n  </font>\n  <font size=\"3\">WEAPON CATEGORIES<br>\n    Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories.<br>\n    These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon's use (simple, martial, or\n    exotic), the weapon's usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown\n    and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small, Medium,\n    or Large).<br>\n    <B>Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons:</B> Anybody but a druid, monk, rogue, or wizard is proficient with all\n    simple weapons. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all simple and all martial weapons.\n    Characters of other classes are proficient with an assortment of mainly simple weapons and possibly also some\n    martial or even exotic weapons. A character who uses a weapon with which he or she is not proficient takes a &#150;4\n    penalty on attack rolls.<br>\n    <B>Melee and Ranged Weapons:</B> Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown\n    as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.<br>\n    <I>Reach Weapons: </I>Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, spiked chains, and whips are reach weapons.\n    A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren't adjacent to him or her.\n    Most reach double the wielder's natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can\n    attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach\n    weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up\n    to 10 feet away.<br>\n    <I>Double Weapons: </I>Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaffs, and\n    two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with\n    two weapons, but he or she incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as though\n    the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.<br>\n    The character can also choose to use a double weapon two handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature\n    wielding a double weapon in one hand can't use it as a double weapon&#151;only one end of the weapon can be used in\n    any given round.<br>\n    <I>Thrown Weapons: </I>Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents,\n    shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his or her Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown\n    weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn't designed to be thrown (that is, a\n    melee weapon that doesn't have a numeric entry in the Range Increment column on Table: Weapons), but a character who\n    does so takes a &#150;4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action,\n    while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a\n    threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment\n    of 10 feet.<br>\n    <I>Projectile Weapons: </I>Light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows,\n    composite longbows, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require\n    two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no Strength bonus on damage rolls with a\n    projectile weapon unless it's a specially built composite shortbow, specially built composite longbow, or sling. If\n    the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he or she uses a bow or a sling.<br>\n    <I>Ammunition: </I>Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), or sling bullets\n    (for slings). When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an\n    action for reloading. Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while\n    normal ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.<br>\n    Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting\n    masterwork or otherwise special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons), and what happens to them after they are\n    thrown.<br>\n    <br>\n    <B>Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons:</B> This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to\n    wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon's size\n    category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.<br>\n    <I>Light: </I>A light weapon is easier to use in one's off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and it can be used\n    while grappling. A light weapon is used in one hand. Add the wielder's Strength bonus (if any) to damage rolls for\n    melee attacks with a light weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or one-half the wielder's Strength bonus if it's\n    used in the off hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on damage; the Strength bonus\n    applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder's primary hand only.<br>\n    An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.<br>\n    <I>One-Handed: </I>A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder's\n    Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or 1/2\n    his or her Strength bonus if it's used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during\n    melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the character's Strength bonus to damage rolls.<br>\n    <I>Two-Handed: </I>Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the\n    character's Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon. <br>\n    <br>\n    <B>Weapon Size:</B> Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which\n    the weapon was designed.<br>\n    A weapon's size category isn't the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon's size category is keyed to the\n    size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder,\n    a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of\n    the same size category as the wielder.<br>\n    <I>Inappropriately Sized Weapons: </I>A creature can't make optimum use of a weapon that isn't properly sized for\n    it. A cumulative &#150;2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of\n    its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn't proficient with the weapon a &#150;4\n    nonproficiency penalty also applies.<br>\n    The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or\n    two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the\n    wielder's size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. If a weapon's designation would be\n    changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can't wield the\n    weapon at all.<br>\n    <B><br>\n      Improvised Weapons:</B> Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such\n    objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses one in combat is considered to be nonproficient with\n    it and takes a &#150;4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate\n    damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a\n    reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical\n    hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.<br>\n    <br>\n    WEAPON QUALITIES<br>\n    Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on Table: Weapons, below).<br>\n    <B>Cost:</B> This value is the weapon's cost in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp). The cost includes\n    miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon.<br>\n    This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.<br>\n    <B>Damage:</B> The Damage columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. The column labeled\n    &#147;Dmg (S)&#148; is for Small weapons. The column labeled &#147;Dmg (M)&#148; is for Medium weapons. If two\n    damage ranges are given then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given for the double\n    weapon's extra attack. Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage gives weapon damage values for weapons of those\n    sizes.<br>\n    <B><br>\n      Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n  </font></B>\n  <table width=\"95%\" border=\"1\">\n    <!-- Table 03 Row 01 -->\n    <tr>\n      <td><B>Medium Weapon Damage</B>",

If a weapon is of two types, the damage it deals is not half one type and\n  half another; all of it is both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore\n  any of the damage from such a weapon.<br>\n  In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation when the damage type is significant,\n  the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.<br>\n  <B>Special:</B> Some weapons have special features.

Containers for Small characters also\n    carry one-quarter the normal amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n    2 See spell description for additional costs. If the additional costs put the spell's total cost above 3,000 gp,\n    that spell is not generally available.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n    <br>\n    ADVENTURING GEAR<br>\n    few of the pieces of adventuring gear found on Table: Goods and Services are described below, along with any special\n    benefits they confer on the user (&#147;you&#148;).<br>\n    <B>Caltrops:</B> A caltrop is a four-pronged iron spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop\n    comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced\n    to slow down to avoid them. One 2- pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.<br>\n    Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an\n    area), it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (using caltrops skill if possessed, counts as weapon)\n    against the creature. For this attack, the creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the\n    creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the attack,\n    the creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by\n    one-half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is\n    successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical curing. A charging or\n    running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can\n    pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.<br>\n    Caltrops may not be effective against unusual opponents.<br>\n    <B>Candle:</B> A candle dimly illuminates a 5-foot radius and burns for 1 hour.<br>\n    <B>Chain:</B> Chain has hardness 10 and 5 hit points. It can be burst with a DC 26 Strength check.<br>\n    <B>Crowbar:</B> A crowbar it grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made for such purposes. If used in\n    combat, treat a crowbar as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of\n    its size.<br>\n    <B>Flint and Steel:</B> Lighting a torch with flint and steel is a full-round action, and lighting any other fire\n    with them takes at least that long.<br>\n    <B>Grappling Hook:</B> Throwing a grappling hook successfully requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 per 10 feet of\n    distance thrown).<br>\n    <B>Hammer:</B> If a hammer is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning\n    damage equal to that of a spiked gauntlet of its size.<br>\n    <B>Ink:</B> This is black ink. You can buy ink in other colors, but it costs twice as much.<br>\n    <B>Jug, Clay:</B> This basic ceramic jug is fitted with a stopper and holds 1 gallon of liquid.<br>\n    <B>Lamp, Common:</B> A lamp clearly illuminates a 15-foot radius, provides shadowy illumination out to a 30-foot\n    radius, and burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand. <br>\n    <B>Lantern, Bullseye:</B> A bullseye lantern provides clear illumination in a 60-foot cone and shadowy illumination\n    in a 120-foot cone. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a bullseye lantern in one hand.<br>\n    <B>Lantern, Hooded:</B> A hooded lantern clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a\n    60-foot radius. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a hooded lantern in one hand.<br>\n    <B>Lock:</B> The DC to open a lock with the Open Lock skill depends on the lock's quality: simple (DC 20), average\n    (DC 25), good (DC 30), or superior (DC 40).<br>\n    <B>Manacles and Manacles, Masterwork:</B> Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the\n    Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a\n    Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.<br>\n    Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the cost of the manacles.<br>\n    For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature.<br>\n    For a Large creature, manacles cost ten times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, one hundred times this\n    amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles.<br>\n    <B>Oil:</B> A pint of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern. You can use a flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the\n    rules for alchemist's fire, except that it takes a full round action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is\n    thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully.<br>\n    You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If\n    lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.<br>\n    <B>Ram, Portable:</B> This iron-shod wooden beam gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to break\n    open a door and it allows a second person to help you without having to roll, increasing your bonus by 2.<br>\n    <B>Rope, Hempen:</B> This rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 23 Strength check.<br>\n    <B>Rope, Silk:</B> This rope has 4 hit points and can be burst with a DC 24 Strength check. It is so supple that it\n    provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Rope checks.<br>\n    <B>Spyglass:</B> Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.<br>\n    <B>Torch:</B> A torch burns for 1 hour, clearly illuminating a 20-foot radius and providing shadowy illumination out\n    to a 40- foot radius. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals\n    bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage.<br>\n    <B>Vial:</B> A vial holds 1 ounce of liquid. The stoppered container usually is no more than 1 inch wide and 3\n    inches high.<br>\n    <br>\n    SPECIAL SUBSTANCES AND ITEMS<br>\n    Any of these substances except for the everburning torch and holy water can be made by a character with the Craft\n    (alchemy) skill.<br>\n    <B>Acid: </B>You can throw a flask of acid as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a\n    range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point\n    where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.<br>\n    <B>Alchemist's Fire:</B> You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged\n    touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.<br>\n    A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1\n    point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points\n    of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this\n    additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target\n    a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the\n    fire.<br>\n    <B>Antitoxin:</B> If you drink antitoxin, you get a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison\n    for 1 hour.<br>\n    <B>Everburning Torch:</B> This otherwise normal torch has a <I>continual flame </I>spell cast upon it. An\n    everburning torch clearly illuminates a 20-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination out to a 40-foot\n    radius.<br>\n    <B>Holy Water:</B> Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy\n    water can be thrown as a splash weapon.<br>\n    Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the\n    body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the\n    holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent\n    to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.<br>\n    A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each\n    such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.<br>\n    Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit).<br>\n    <B>Smokestick:</B> This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when ignited. The\n    smoke fills a 10- foot cube (treat the effect as a <I>fog cloud </I>spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind\n    dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally.<br>\n    <B>Sunrod:</B> This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. It clearly illuminates a 30-foot\n    radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is\n    burned out and worthless.<br>\n    <B>Tanglefoot Bag:</B> When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range\n    increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and\n    resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls and a &#150;4 penalty\n    to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save,\n    it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is\n    not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly)\n    and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.<br>\n    A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by\n    dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or\n    another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the\n    creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move\n    (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a DC 15\n    Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing\n    its effectiveness. An application of <I>universal solvent</I> to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo\n    immediately.<br>\n    <B>Thunderstone:</B> You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When it strikes\n    a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature\n    within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in\n    addition to the obvious effects, takes a &#150;4 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any\n    spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast.<br>\n    Since you don't need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the target\n    square as AC 5.<br>\n    <B>Tindertwig:</B> The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a\n    rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a\n    magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action (rather than a full-round\n    action), and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action.<br>\n    <br>\n    TOOLS AND SKILL KITS<br>\n    <B>Alchemist's Lab:</B> An alchemist's lab always has the perfect tool for making alchemical items, so it provides a\n    +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks. It has no bearing on the costs related to the Craft (alchemy)\n    skill. Without this lab, a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill is assumed to have enough tools to use the skill\n    but not enough to get the +2 bonus that the lab provides.<br>\n    <B>Artisan's Tools:</B> These special tools include the items needed to pursue any craft. Without them, you have to\n    use improvised tools (&#150;2 penalty on Craft checks), if you can do the job at all.<br>\n    <B>Artisan's Tools, Masterwork:</B> These tools serve the same purpose as artisan's tools (above), but masterwork\n    artisan's tools are the perfect tools for the job, so you get a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft checks made with\n    them.<br>\n    <B>Climber's Kit:</B> This is the perfect tool for climbing and gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb\n    checks.<br>\n    <B>Disguise Kit:</B> The kit is the perfect tool for disguise and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise\n    checks.

A cleric or paladin uses it as the\n    focus for his spells and as a tool for turning undead. Each religion has its own holy symbol.<br>\n    <I>Unholy Symbols: </I>An unholy symbol is like a holy symbol except that it focuses negative energy and is used by\n    evil clerics (or by neutral clerics who want to cast evil spells or command undead).<br>\n    <B>Magnifying Glass:</B> This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute\n    for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as\n    sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a full-round action.

It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on a\n    related skill check (if any). Bonuses provided by multiple masterwork items used toward the same skill check do not\n    stack.<br>\n    <B>Water Clock: </B>This large, bulky contrivance gives the time accurate to within half an hour per day since it\n    was last set. It requires a source of water, and it must be kept still because it marks time by the regulated flow\n    of droplets of water.<br>\n    <br>\n    CLOTHING<br>\n    <B>Artisan's Outfit: </B>This outfit includes a shirt with buttons, a skirt or pants with a drawstring, shoes, and\n    perhaps a cap or hat.

If you wear\n    this outfit without jewelry (costing an additional 50 gp), you look like an out-of-place commoner.<br>\n    <B>Entertainer's Outfit:</B> This set of flashy, perhaps even gaudy, clothes is for entertaining. While the outfit\n    looks whimsical, its practical design lets you tumble, dance, walk a tightrope, or just run (if the audience turns\n    ugly).<br>\n    <B>Explorer's Outfit:</B> This is a full set of clothes for someone who never knows what to expect. It includes\n    sturdy boots, leather breeches or a skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak.\n    Rather than a leather skirt, a leather overtunic may be worn over a cloth skirt.

Precious metals\n    and gems are worked into the clothing. To fit into the noble crowd, every would-be noble also needs a signet ring\n    (see Adventuring Gear, above) and jewelry (worth at least 100 gp).<br>\n    <B>Peasant's Outfit:</B> This set of clothes consists of a loose shirt and baggy breeches, or a loose shirt and\n    skirt or overdress. Cloth wrappings are used for shoes.<br>\n    <B>Royal Outfit:</B> This is just the clothing, not the royal scepter, crown, ring, and other accoutrements. Royal\n    clothes are ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance.<br>\n    <B>Scholar's Outfit: </B>Perfect for a scholar, this outfit includes a robe, a belt, a cap, soft shoes, and possibly\n    a cloak.<br>\n    <B>Traveler's Outfit:</B> This set of clothes consists of boots, a wool skirt or breeches, a sturdy belt, a shirt\n    (perhaps with a vest or jacket), and an ample cloak with a hood.<br>\n    <br>\n    FOOD, DRINK, AND LODGING<br>\n    <B>Inn:</B> Poor accommodations at an inn amount to a place on the floor near the hearth.

Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection\n    than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on Table: Armor\n    and Shields.<br>\n    Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as much as armor for a human (a Medium humanoid\n    creature) and also weighs twice as much as the armor found on Table: Armor and Shields (see Armor for Unusual\n    Creatures). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the same\n    as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table\n    below.<br>\n    <br>\n    <table width=\"95%\" border=\"1\">\n      <!-- Table 22 Row 01 -->\n      <tr>\n        <td><B> </B></td>\n        <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"3\"><B>&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151; Base Speed &#151;&#150;&#150;&#151;&#151;</B></td>\n      </tr>\n      <!-- Table 22 Row 02 -->\n      <tr>\n        <td><B>Barding</B>",
