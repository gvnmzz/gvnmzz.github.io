</U><font size="5">MONSTERS (INTRO-A)<br>
</font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="5">READING THE ENTRIES<br>
</font><font size="3">Each monster description is organized in the same general format, as outlined below. <br>
<I><br>
</I>STATISTICS BLOCK<br>
This portion of a monster description contains basic game information on the creature.<br>
<B>Name<br>
</B>This is the name by which the creature is generally known. The descriptive text may provide other names.<br>
<B>Size and Type<br>
</B>This line describes the creature's size. A size modifier applies to the creature's Armor Class (AC) and attack bonus, as well as to certain skills. A creature's size also determines how far it can reach to make a melee attack and how much space it occupies in a fight (see Space/Reach, below). <br>
The size and type line continues with the creature's type. Type determines how magic affects a creature. Type determines certain features, such as Hit Dice size, base attack bonus, base saving throw bonuses, and skill points. <br>
<B>Hit Dice<br>
</B>This line gives the creature's number and type of Hit Dice, and lists any bonus hit points. A parenthetical note gives the average hit points for a creature of the indicated number of Hit Dice. A creature's Hit Dice total is also treated as its level for determining how spells affect the creature, its rate of natural healing, and its maximum ranks in a skill.<br>
<B>Initiative<br>
</B>This line gives the creature's modifier on initiative checks.<br>
<B>Speed<br>
</B>This line gives the creature's tactical speed on land (the amount of distance it can cover in one move action). If the creature wears armor that reduces its speed, the creature's base land speed follows.<br>
If the creature has other modes of movement, these are given after (or in place of) the land speed. Unless noted otherwise, modes of movement are natural (not magical).<br>
<B>Armor Class<br>
</B>The Armor Class line gives the creature's AC for normal combat and includes a parenthetical mention of the modifiers contributing to it (usually size, Dexterity, and natural armor). The creature's touch and flat-footed ACs follow the combat-ready AC.<br>
A creature's armor proficiencies (if it has any) depend on its type, but in general a creature is automatically proficient with any kind of armor it is described as wearing (light, medium, or heavy), and with all lighter kinds of armor.<br>
<B>Base Attack/Grapple<br>
</B>The number before the slash on this line is the creature's base attack bonus (before any modifiers are applied). This number won't often be used, but it can be handy sometimes, especially if the creature has the Power Attack or Combat Expertise feats.<br>
The number after the slash is the creature's grapple bonus, which is used when the creature makes a grapple attack or when someone tries to grapple the creature. The grapple bonus includes all modifiers that apply to the creature's grapple checks (base attack bonus, Strength modifier, special size modifier, and any other applicable modifier, such as a racial bonus on grapple checks).<br>
<B>Attack<br>
</B>This line shows the single attack the creature makes with an attack action. In most cases, this is also the attack the creature uses when making an attack of opportunity as well. The attack line provides the weapon used (natural or manufactured), attack bonus, and form of attack (melee or ranged). The attack bonus given includes modifications for size and Strength (for melee attacks) or Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A creature with the Weapon Finesse feat can use its Dexterity modifier on melee attacks. If the creature uses natural attacks, the natural weapon given here is the creature's primary natural weapon. If the creature has several different weapons at its disposal, the alternatives are shown, with each different attack separated by the word &#147;or.&#148; A creature can use one of its secondary natural weapons when making an attack action, but if it does it takes an attack penalty, as noted in the Full Attack section below. The damage that each attack deals is noted parenthetically. Damage from an attack is always at least 1 point, even if a subtraction from a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.<br>
<B>Full Attack<br>
</B>This line shows all the physical attacks the creature makes when it uses a full-round action to make a full attack. It gives the number of attacks along with the weapon, attack bonus, and form of attack (melee or ranged). The first entry is for the creature's primary weapon, with an attack bonus including modifications for size and Strength (for melee attacks) or Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A creature with the Weapon Finesse feat can use its Dexterity modifier on melee attacks. The remaining weapons are secondary, and attacks with them are made with a &#150;5 penalty to the attack roll, no matter how many there are. Creatures with the Multiattack feat take only a &#150;2 penalty on secondary attacks. The damage that each attack deals is noted parenthetically. Damage from an attack is always at least 1 point, even if a subtraction from a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.<br>
A creature's primary attack damage includes its full Strength modifier (1-1/2 times its Strength bonus if the attack is with the creature's sole natural weapon) and is given first. Secondary attacks add only 1/2 the creature's Strength bonus and are given second in the parentheses. <br>
If any attacks also have some special effect other than damage, that information is given here.<br>
Unless noted otherwise, creatures using natural weapons deal double damage on critical hits.<br>
<B>Manufactured Weapons:</B> Creatures that use swords, bows, spears, and the like follow the same rules as characters do. The bonus for attacks with two-handed weapons is 1-1/2 times the creature's Strength modifier (if it is a bonus), and is given first. Offhand weapons add only 1/2 the Strength bonus and are given second in the parentheses.<br>
<B>Space/Reach<br>
</B>This line describes how much space the creature takes up on the battle grid and thereby needs to fight effectively, as well as how close it has to be to threaten an opponent. The number before the slash is the creature's space, or how many feet one side of the creature occupies. The number after the slash is the creature's natural reach. If the creature has exceptional reach due to a weapon, tentacle, or the like, the extended reach and its source are noted in parentheses at the end of the line.<br>
<B>Special Attacks and Special Qualities<br>
</B>Many creatures have unusual abilities. A monster entry breaks these abilities into special attacks and special qualities. The latter category includes defenses, vulnerabilities, and other special abilities that are not modes of attack. A special ability is either extraordinary (Ex), spell-like (Sp), or supernatural (Su). Additional information (when needed) is provided in the creature's descriptive text.<br>
When a special ability allows a saving throw, the kind of save and the save DC is noted in the descriptive text. Most saving throws against special abilities have DCs calculated as follows: 10 + 1/2 the attacker's racial Hit Dice + the relevant ability modifier.<br>
The save DC is given in the creature's description along with the ability on which the DC is based.<br>
<B>Saves<br>
</B>This line gives the creature's Fortitude, Reflex, and Will save modifiers.<br>
<B>Abilities<br>
</B>This line lists the creature's ability scores, in the customary order: Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha. Except where noted otherwise, each creature is assumed to have the standard array of ability scores before racial adjustments (all 11s and 10s). To determine any creature's racial ability adjustments, subtract 10 from any even-numbered ability score and subtract 11 from any odd-numbered score. (Exceptions are noted in the Combat section of a creature's descriptive text.) <br>
<B>Strength:</B> Quadrupeds can carry heavier loads than bipeds can. Any creature with four or more motive limbs can carry a load as a quadruped, even if it does not necessarily use all the limbs at once.<br>
<B>Intelligence:</B> A creature can speak all the languages mentioned in its description, plus one additional language per point of Intelligence bonus. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher understands at least one language (Common, unless noted otherwise).<br>
<B>Nonabilities:</B> Some creatures lack certain ability scores. These creatures do not have an ability score of 0&#151;they lack the ability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. <br>
<B>Skills<br>
</B>This line gives the creature's skills, along with each skill's modifier (including adjustments for ability scores, armor check penalties, and any bonuses from feats or racial traits). All listed skills are class skills, unless the creature has a character class (noted in the entry). A creature's type and Intelligence score determine the number of skill points it has.<br>
The Skills section of the creature's description recaps racial bonuses and other adjustments to skill modifiers for the sake of clarity; these bonuses should not be added to the listed skill modifiers.<br>
An asterisk (*) beside the relevant score and in the Skills section of the descriptive text indicates a conditional adjustment, one that applies only in certain situations.<br>
<B>Natural Tendencies:</B> Some creatures simply aren't made for certain types of physical activity. If it seems clear that a particular creature simply is not made for a particular physical activity, that creature takes a &#150;8 penalty on skill checks that defy its natural tendencies.<br>
In extreme circumstances the creature fails the check automatically.<br>
<B>Feats<br>
</B>The line gives the creature's feats. A monster gains feats just as a character does. Sometimes a creature has one or more bonus feats, marked with a superscript B (<sup></font><font size="2">B</sup></font><font size="3">). Creatures often do not have the prerequisites for a bonus feat. If this is so, the creature can still use the feat. If you wish to customize the creature with new feats, you can reassign its other feats, but not its bonus feats. A creature cannot have a feat that is not a bonus feat unless it has the feat's prerequisites.<br>
<B>Environment<br>
</B>This line gives a type of climate and terrain where the creature is typically found. This describes a tendency, but is not exclusionary.<br>
<B>Organization<br>
</B>This line describes the kinds of groups the creature might form. A range of numbers in parentheses indicates how many combat-ready adults are in each type of group. Many groups also have a number of noncombatants, expressed as a percentage of the fighting population. Noncombatants can include young, the infirm, slaves, or other individuals who are not inclined to fight. If the organization line contains the term &#147;domesticated,&#148; the creature is generally found only in the company of other creatures, whom it serves in some capacity.<br>
<B>Challenge Rating<br>
</B>This shows the average level of a party of adventurers for which one creature would make an encounter of moderate difficulty.<br>
<B>Treasure<br>
</B>This line reflects how much wealth the creature owns<I>. </I>In most cases, a creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures that own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home.<br>
<B>Alignment<br>
</B>This line gives the alignment that the creature is most likely to have. Every entry includes a qualifier that indicates how broadly that alignment applies to the species as a whole.<br>
<B>Advancement<br>
</B>The monster entry usually describes only the most commonly encountered version of a creature. The advancement line shows how tough a creature can get, in terms of extra Hit Dice. (This is not an absolute limit, but exceptions are extremely rare.) Often, intelligent creatures advance by gaining a level in a character class instead of just gaining a new Hit Die.<br>
<B>Level Adjustment<br>
</B>This line is included in the entries of creatures suitable for use as player characters or as cohorts (usually creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 3 and possessing opposable thumbs). Add this number to the creature's total Hit Dice, including class levels, to get the creature's effective character level (ECL). A character's ECL affects the experience the character earns, the amount of experience the character must have before gaining a new level, and the character's starting equipment.<br>

The aboleth is a revolting fishlike amphibian found primarily in subterranean lakes and rivers. An aboleth has a pink belly. Four pulsating blueblack orifices line the bottom of its body and secrete gray slime that smells like rancid grease. It uses its tail for propulsion in the water and drags itself along with its tentacles on land. An aboleth weighs about 6,500 pounds.<br>
Aboleths speak their own language, as well as Undercommon and Aquan.<br>
COMBAT<br>
An aboleth attacks by flailing with its long, slimy tentacles, though it prefers to fight from a distance using its illusion powers.<br>
<B>Enslave (Su):</B> Three times per day, an aboleth can attempt to enslave any one living creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be affected as though by a <I>dominate person </I>spell (caster level 16th). An enslaved creature obeys the aboleth's telepathic commands until freed by <I>remove curse, </I>and can attempt a new Will save every 24 hours to break free. The control is also broken if the aboleth dies or travels more than 1 mile from its slave. The save DC is Charisma-based.<br>
<B>Psionics (Sp):</B> At will&#151;<I>hypnotic pattern </I>(DC 15), <I>illusory wall </I>(DC 17), <I>mirage arcana </I>(DC 18), <I>persistent image </I>(DC 18), <I>programmed image </I>(DC 19), <I>project image </I>(DC 20), <I>veil </I>(DC 19). Effective caster level 16th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.<br>
<B>Slime (Ex):</B> A blow from an aboleth's tentacle can cause a terrible affliction. A creature hit by a tentacle must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or begin to transform over the next 1d4+1 minutes, the skin gradually becoming a clear, slimy membrane. An afflicted creature must remain moistened with cool, fresh water or take 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. The slime reduces the creature's natural armor bonus by 1 (but never to less than 0). The save DC is Constitution-based.<br>
A <I>remove disease </I>spell cast before the transformation is complete will restore an afflicted creature to normal. Afterward, however, only a <I>heal </I>or <I>mass heal </I>spell can reverse the affliction.<br>
<B>Mucus Cloud (Ex):</B> An aboleth underwater surrounds itself with a viscous cloud of mucus roughly 1 foot thick. Any creature coming into contact with and inhaling this substance must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or lose the ability to breathe air for the next 3 hours. An affected creature suffocates in 2d6 minutes if removed from the water. Renewed contact with the mucus cloud and failing another Fortitude save continues the effect for another 3 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.<br>
<B>Skills:</B> An aboleth has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.<br>

Achaierais are massive, 15-foot-tall flightless birds that inhabit lawful planes of battle and are only occasionally encountered elsewhere. <br>
Achaierais speak Infernal. They weigh about 750 pounds.<br>
COMBAT<br>
In close combat, an achaierai lashes out with two of its four legs and snaps with its powerful beak. It makes frequent use of its Spring Attack feat to strike quickly and then retreat out of range before an enemy can counterattack.<br>
An achaierai's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawfulaligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br>
<B>Black Cloud (Ex):</B> Up to three times per day an achaierai can release a choking, toxic black cloud.<br>
Those other than achaierai within 10 feet instantly take 2d6 points of damage. They must also succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be affected for 3 hours as though by an <I>insanity </I>spell (caster level 16th). The save DC is Constitution-based.<br>

An allip is the spectral remains of someone driven to suicide by a madness that afflicted it in life. It craves only revenge and unrelentingly pursues those who tormented it in life and pushed it over the brink. <br>
An allip cannot speak intelligibly.<br>
COMBAT<br>
An allip is unable to cause physical harm, although it doesn't appear to know that. It keeps flailing away at enemies, yet it inflicts no wounds.<br>
<B>Babble (Su):</B> An allip constantly mutters and whines to itself, creating a hypnotic effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of the allip must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be affected as though by a <I>hypnotism </I>spell for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect.<br>
Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same allip's babble for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.<br>
<B>Madness (Su):</B> Anyone targeting an allip with a thought detection, mind control, or telepathic ability makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.<br>
<B>Wisdom Drain (Su): </B>An allip causes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain each time it hits with its incorporeal touch attack. On each such successful attack, it gains 5 temporary hit points.<br>
<font size="5"><br>
ANGEL<br>
</font><font size="3">Angels are a race of celestials, beings who live on the good-aligned Outer Planes.<br>
Angels can be of any good alignment. Regardless of their alignment, angels never lie, cheat, or steal. They are impeccably honorable in all their dealings and often prove the most trustworthy and diplomatic of all the celestials.<br>
All angels are blessed with comely looks, though their actual appearances vary widely.<br>
Angels speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, though they can speak with almost any creature because of their tongues ability.<br>
COMBAT<br>
In combat, most angels make full use of their mobility and their ability to attack at a distance.<br>
<B>Angel Traits:</B> An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).<br>
&#151;Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.<br>
&#151;Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification.<br>
&#151;Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.<br>
&#151; +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.<br>
&#151;<I>Protective Aura (Su): </I>Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a <I>magic circle against evil </I>effect and a <I>lesser globe of invulnerability, </I>both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals angel's HD). This aura can be dispelled, but the angel can create it again as a free action on its next turn. (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel's statistics block.)<br>
&#151;<I>Tongues (Su): </I>All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <I>tongues </I>spell (caster level equal to angel's Hit Dice). This ability is always active.<br>

Animated objects come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. They owe their existence as creatures to spells such as <I>animate objects </I>or similar supernatural abilities.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Animated objects fight only as directed by the animator. They follow orders without question and to the best of their abilities. Since they do not need to breathe and never tire, they can be extremely capable minions. <br>
An animated object can have one or more of the following special abilities, depending on its form.<br>
<B>Blind (Ex):</B> A sheetlike animated object such as a carpet or tapestry can grapple an opponent up to three sizes larger than itself. The object makes a normal grapple check. If it wins, it wraps itself around the opponent's head, causing that creature to be blinded until removed.<br>
<B>Constrict (Ex): </B>A flexible animated object such as a rope, vine, or rug deals damage equal to its slam damage value plus 1- 1/2 times its Strength bonus with a successful grapple check against a creature up to one size larger than itself.<br>
An object of at least Large size can make constriction attacks against multiple creatures at once, if they all are at least two sizes smaller than the object and can fit under it.<br>
<B>Hardness (Ex): </B>An animated object has the same hardness it had before it was animated.<br>
<B>Improved Speed (Ex):</B> The base land speed given in the statistics block assume that an animated object lurches, rocks, or slithers along.<br>
Objects with two legs (statues, ladders) or a similar shape that allows faster movement have a +10 foot bonus to speed. Objects with multiple legs (tables, chairs) have a +20 foot bonus to speed. Wheeled objects have a +40 foot bonus to speed.<br>
Objects might have additional modes of movement. A wooden object can float and has a swim speed equal to half its land speed. A rope or similar sinuous object has a climb speed equal to half its land speed. A sheetlike object can fly (clumsy maneuverability) at half its normal speed.<br>
<B>Trample (Ex): </B>An animated object of at least Large size and with a hardness of at least 10 can trample creatures two or more sizes smaller than itself, dealing damage equal to the object's slam damage + 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus. Opponents who do not make attacks of opportunity against the object can attempt Reflex saves (DC 10 + 1/2 object's HD + object's Str modifier) to halve the damage.<br>

The ankheg is a burrowing monster with a taste for fresh meat. An ankheg has six legs, and some specimens are yellow rather than brown. It is about 10 feet long and weighs about 800 pounds.<br>
An ankheg burrows with legs and mandibles. A burrowing ankheg usually does not make a usable tunnel, but can construct a tunnel; it burrows at half speed when it does so. It often digs a winding tunnel up to 40 feet below the surface in the rich soil of forests or farmlands. The tunnel is 5 feet tall and wide, and from 60 to 150 feet long ([1d10 + 5] x?10). <br>
COMBAT<br>
An ankheg usually lies 5 to 10 feet below the surface until its antennae detect the approach of prey. It then burrows up to attack. (Treat this as a charge, even though the ankheg does not need to move 10 feet before attacking.)<br>
Clusters of ankhegs share the same territory but do not cooperate.<br>
<B>Improved Grab (Ex): </B>To use this ability, an ankheg must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the ankheg is damaged after grabbing its prey, it retreats backward down its tunnel at its land speed (not its burrow speed), dragging the victim with it.<br>
<B>Spit Acid (Ex):</B> 30-ft. line, once every 6 hours; damage 4d4 acid, Reflex DC 14 half. One such attack depletes the ankheg's acid supply for 6 hours. It cannot spit acid or deal acid damage during this time. The save DC is Constitution-based.<br>
An ankheg does not use this ability unless it is desperate or frustrated. It most often spits acid when reduced to fewer than half its full normal hit points or when it has not successfully grabbed an opponent.<br>

An aranea is an intelligent, shapechanging spider with sorcerous powers. In its natural form, an aranea resembles a big spider, with a humpbacked body a little bigger than a human torso. It has fanged mandibles like a normal spider. Two small arms, each about 2 feet long, lie below the mandibles. Each arm has a hand with four many-jointed fingers and a double-jointed thumb.<br>
An aranea weighs about 150 pounds. The hump on its back houses its brain.<br>
Araneas speak Common and Sylvan.<br>
COMBAT<br>
An aranea avoids physical combat and uses its webs and spells when it can. In a battle, it tries to immobilize or distract the most aggressive opponents first. Araneas often subdue opponents for ransom.<br>
<B>Poison (Ex):</B> Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.<br>
<B>Spells:</B> An aranea casts spells as a 3rd-level sorcerer. It prefers illusions and enchantments and avoids fire spells.<br>
<I>Typical Sorcerer Spells Known </I>(6/6; save DC 12 + spell level): 0&#151; <I>daze, detect magic, ghost sound, light, resistance; </I>1st&#151;<I>mage armor, silent image, sleep.<br>
</I><B>Web (Ex):</B> In spider or hybrid form (see below), an aranea can throw a web up to six times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of up to Large size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.<br>
An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a DC 17 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based, and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus. The web has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire.<br>
<B>Change Shape (Su):</B> An aranea's natural form is that of a Medium monstrous spider. It can assume two other forms. The first is a unique Small or Medium humanoid; an aranea in its humanoid form always assumes the same appearance and traits, much as a lycanthrope would. In humanoid form, an aranea cannot use its bite attack, webs, or poison.<br>
The second form is a Medium spider&#150;humanoid hybrid. In hybrid form, an aranea looks like a Medium humanoid at first glance, but a DC 18 Spot check reveals the creature's fangs and spinnerets. The aranea retains its bite attack, webs, and poison in this form, and can also wield weapons or wear armor. When in hybrid form, an aranea's speed is 30 feet (6 squares).<br>
An aranea remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does an aranea revert to its natural form when killed. A <I>true seeing </I>spell, however, reveals its natural form if it is in humanoid or hybrid form.<br>
<B>Skills:</B> Araneas have a +2 racial bonus on Jump, Listen, and Spot checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks even if rushed or threatened.<br>
<font size="5"><br>
ARCHON<br>
</font><font size="3">Archons are celestials from a lawful good-aligned plane.<br>
Archons speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can speak with almost any creature because of their tongues ability.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Archons generally prefer to meet a foe head-on if it is prudent to do so, but if outmatched, they do what they can to even the odds (usually by employing hit-and run tactics or standing off and engaging a foe with magic before moving into melee).<br>
<B>Archon Traits:</B> An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).<br>
&#151;Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.<br>
&#151;<I>Aura of Menace (Su): </I>A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a &#150;2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon's aura for 24 hours.<br>
&#151;Immunity to electricity and petrification.<br>

Each Trumpet Archon carries a gleaming silver trumpet about 6 feet long.<br>

A trumpet archon usually disdains physical combat, preferring to obliterate foes with spells quickly and return to its duties. If forced into an extended battle, it sounds its trumpet and attacks with a vengeance.<br>
A trumpet archon's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br>

<B>Spells: </B>Trumpet archons can cast divine spells as 14th-level clerics. A trumpet archon has access to two of the following domains: Air, Destruction, Good, Law, or War (plus any others from its deity). The save DCs are Wisdom-based.<br>

<B>Trumpet (Su): </B>An archon's trumpet produces music of utter clarity, piercing beauty, and, if the trumpet archon wills it, paralyzing awe. All creatures except archons within 100 feet of the blast must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. The archon can also command its trumpet to become a <I>+4 greatsword </I>as a free action.<br>
If a trumpet is ever stolen, it becomes a chunk of useless metal until the owner can recover it. Woe betide any thief caught with one.<br>

An arrowhawk is a predator and scavenger from the Elemental Plane of Air.  By twisting its body and varying the cadence of its wingbeats, an arrowhawk can fly at top speed in any direction. A juvenile arrowhawk (1 to 10 years old) is about 5 feet long from beak to tail, with the body accounting for about one-third of that length. Its wingspan is about 7 feet, and it weighs about 20 pounds. An adult (11 to 40 years old) is about 10 feet long from beak to tail, with a wingspan of about 15 feet and a weight of about 100 pounds. An elder arrowhawk (41 to 75 years old) is about 20 feet long with a wingspan of 30 feet and a weight of about 800 pounds.<br>
Arrowhawks speak Auran, but they are not usually talkative creatures.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Arrowhawks are extremely territorial and always hungry. They attack almost any other creature they meet, seeking a meal or trying to drive away a rival. The primary mode of attack is an electricity ray, fired from the tail. The creature also bites, but it prefers to stay out of reach.<br>
<B>Electricity Ray (Su):</B> An arrowhawk can fire this ray once per round, with a range of 50 feet.<br>

The assassin vine is a semi-mobile plant that collects its own grisly fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing the carcasses near its roots.<br>
A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor. Assassin vine berries make a heady wine.<br>
An assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but usually stays put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity.<br>
A subterranean version of the assassin vine grows near hot springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of thermal energy. These plants have thin, wiry stems and gray leaves shot through with silver, brown, and white veins so that they resemble mineral deposits. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.<br>
COMBAT<br>
An assassin vine uses simple tactics:<br>
It lies still until prey comes within reach, then attacks. It uses its entangle ability both to catch prey and to deter counterattacks.<br>
<B>Constrict (Ex):</B> An assassin vine deals 1d6+7 points of damage with a successful grapple check.<br>
<B>Entangle (Su): </B>An assassin vine can animate plants within 30 feet of itself as a free action (Ref DC 13 partial).<br>
The effect lasts until the vine dies or decides to end it (also a free action). The save DC is Wisdom-based. The ability is otherwise similar to <I>entangle </I>(caster level 4th).<br>
<B>Improved Grab (Ex):</B> To use this ability, an assassin vine must hit with its slam attack.<br>
It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.<br>
If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.<br>
<B>Blindsight (Ex): </B>Assassin vines have no visual organs but can ascertain all foes within 30 feet using sound, scent, and vibration.<br>
<B>Camouflage (Ex):</B> Since an assassin vine looks like a normal plant when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Spot check to notice it before it attacks.<br>
Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Spot to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the subterranean version.<br>

The athach is a hulking, misshapen biped. An adult stands some 18 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. Athachs speak a crude dialect of Giant.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Athachs charge into melee combat unless their opponents are out of reach, in which case they throw rocks. They sometimes try to overrun armored opponents to reach unarmored opponents in back ranks. With its first few melee attacks, an athach tends to flail about indiscriminately. After a few rounds, it concentrates on foes that have been hitting it most often and uses its bite on whoever has dealt it the most damage.<br>
<B>Poison (Ex): </B>Injury, Fortitude DC 22, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.<br>

An avoral's bones are strong but hollow, so even the largest specimens weigh no more than 120 pounds. An avoral is about 7 feet tall. Each of an avoral's wings has a small hand at the midpoint. When the wings are folded, these appendages are about where human hands would be and can do nearly anything hands can do.<br>
An avoral's visual acuity is virtually unmatched: It can see detail on objects up to 10 miles away and is said to be able to discern the color of a creature's eyes at 200 paces.<br>
Avorals speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can speak with almost any creature, thanks to their <I>tongues </I>ability.<br>
<br>
Combat<br>
On the ground, an avoral can lash out with its wings to deliver punishing blows. However, it prefers to meet its foes in the air, where it can employ its talons and make full use of its aerial speed and agility. It can't make wing attacks while flying, however.<br>
An avoral's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br>
<B>Spell-Like Abilities:</B> At will&#151;<I>aid, blur </I>(self only), <I>command </I>(DC 14), <I>detect magic, dimension door, dispel magic, gust of wind </I>(DC 15), <I>hold person </I>(DC 16), <I>light, magic circle against evil </I>(self only), <I>magic missile, see invisibility; </I>3/day&#151;<I>lightning bolt </I>(DC 16). Caster level 8th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.<br>
<B>Fear Aura (Su):</B> Once per day an avoral can create an aura of fear in a 20-foot radius. It is otherwise identical with <I>fear </I>from an 8th-level caster (save DC 17). The save DC is Charisma-based.<br>
<B>Lay on Hands (Su):</B> As the paladin class feature, except that each day, an avoral can heal an amount of damage equal to its full normal hit points.<br>
<B>Speak with Animals (Su):</B> This ability works like <I>speak with animals </I>(caster level 8th) but is a free action and does not require sound.<br>
<B>True Seeing (Su):</B> This ability is identical with <I>true seeing </I>(caster level 14th), except that it has personal range and the avoral must concentrate for 1 full round before it takes effect. Thereafter the ability remains in effect as long as the avoral concentrates on it.  <br>
<B>Skills:</B> An avoral's sharp eyes give it a +8 racial bonus on Spot checks.<br>

Azers are dwarflike beings native to the Elemental Plane of Fire. They wear kilts of brass, bronze, or copper, and speak Ignan and Common.<br>
COMBAT<br>
Azers use broad-headed spears or well-crafted hammers in combat. When unarmed, they attempt to grapple foes.<br>
Although unfriendly and taciturn, azers rarely provoke a fight except to relieve a foe of gems, which they love. If threatened, they fight to the death, but they see the value of taking prisoners themselves.<br>
<B>Heat (Ex):</B> An azer's body is intensely hot, so its unarmed attacks deal extra fire damage. Its metallic weapons also conduct this heat.<br>
AZERS AS CHARACTERS<br>
Azer characters possess the following racial traits.<br>
&#151; +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, &#150;2 Charisma.<br>
&#151;Medium size.<br>
&#151;An azer's base land speed is 30 feet.<br>
&#151;Darkvision: Azers can see in the dark up to 60 feet.<br>
&#151;Racial Hit Dice: An azer begins with two levels of outsider, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +3, and Will +3.<br>
&#151;Racial Skills: An azer's outsider levels give it skill points equal to 5 x (8 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Appraise, Climb, Craft, Hide, Jump, Listen, Search, and Spot.<br>
&#151;Racial Feats: An azer's outsider levels give it one feat.<br>
