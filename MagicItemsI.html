    <font size="5">MAGIC ITEMS I (BASICS & CREATION)</font>
    <font size="5"><br>
        <font size="3">Magic items are divided into categories: armor, weapons, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs,
            wands, and wondrous items. In addition, some magic items are cursed or intelligent. Finally, a few magic
            items are of such rarity and power that they are considered to belong to a category of their own: artifacts.
            Artifacts are classified in turn as minor (extremely rare but not one-of-a-kind items) or major (each one
            unique and extremely potent).<br>
            <B>Armor and Shields:</B> Magic armor (including shields) offers improved, magical protection to the wearer.
            Some of these items confer abilities beyond a benefit to Armor Class. <br>
            <B>Weapons:</B> Magic weapons are created with a variety of combat powers and almost always improve the
            attack and damage rolls of the wielder as well.<br>
            <B>Potions:</B> A potion is an elixir concocted with a spell-like effect that affects only the drinker.<br>
            <B>Rings:</B> A ring is a circular metal band worn on the finger (no more than two rings per wearer) that
            has a spell-like power (often a constant effect that affects the wearer).<br>
            <B>Rods: </B>A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power unlike that of any known spell.<br>
            <B>Scrolls:</B> A scroll is a spell magically inscribed onto paper or parchment so that it can be used
            later.<br>
            <B>Staffs:</B> A staff has a number of different (but often related) spell effects. A newly created staff
            has 50 charges.<br>
            <B>Wands:</B> A wand is a short stick imbued with the power to cast a specific spell. A newly created wand
            has 25 charges.<br>
            <B>Wondrous Items:</B> These objects include magic jewelry, tools, books, clothing, and much more.<br>
            <br>
            Magic Items and Detect Magic<br>
            When <I>detect magic </I>identifies a magic item's school of magic, this information refers to the school of
            the spell placed within the potion, scroll, or wand, or the prerequisite given for the item. The description
            of each item provides its aura strength and the school it belongs to.<br>
            If more than one spell is given as a prerequisite, use the highest-level spell. If no spells are included in
            the prerequisites, use the following default guidelines.<br>

            USING ITEMS<br>
            To use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation simply means putting a ring on your
            finger. Some items, once donned, function constantly. In most cases, using an item requires a standard
            action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, spell completion items are treated like
            spells in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.<br>
            Activating a magic item is a standard action unless the item description indicates otherwise. However, the
            casting time of a spell is the time required to activate the same power in an item, regardless of the type
            of magic item, unless the item description specifically states otherwise.<br>
            The four ways to activate magic items are described below.<br>
            <B>Spell Completion:</B> This is the activation method for scrolls. A scroll is a spell that is mostly
            finished. The preparation is done for the caster, so no preparation time is needed beforehand as with normal
            spellcasting. All that's left to do is perform the finishing parts of the spellcasting (the final gestures,
            words, and so on). To use a spell completion item safely, a character must be of high enough level in the
            right class to cast the spell already. If he can't already cast the spell, there's a chance he'll make a
            mistake. Activating a spell completion item is a standard action and provokes attacks of opportunity exactly
            as casting a spell does.<br>
            <B>Spell Trigger:</B> Spell trigger activation is similar to spell completion, but it's even simpler. No
            gestures or spell finishing is needed, just a special knowledge of spellcasting that an appropriate
            character would know, and a single word that must be spoken. Anyone with a spell on his or her spell list
            knows how to use a spell trigger item that stores that spell. (This is the case even for a character who
            can't actually cast spells, such as a 3rd-level paladin.) The user must still determine what spell is stored
            in the item before she can activate it. Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action and does not
            provoke attacks of opportunity.<br>
            <B>Command Word: </B>If no activation method is suggested either in the magic item description or by the
            nature of the item, assume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means that
            a character speaks the word and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed.<br>
            A command word can be a real word, but when this is the case, the holder of the item runs the risk of
            activating the item accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often, the command word
            is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common use.
            Activating a command word magic item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.<br>
            Sometimes the command word to activate an item is written right on the item. Occasionally, it might be
            hidden within a pattern or design engraved on, carved into, or built into the item, or the item might bear a
            clue to the command word.<br>
            The Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) skills might be useful in helping to identify command words
            or deciphering clues regarding them. A successful check against DC 30 is needed to come up with the word
            itself. If that check is failed, succeeding on a second check (DC 25) might provide some insight into a
            clue.<br>
            The spells <I>identify </I>and <I>analyze dweomer </I>both reveal command words.<br>
            <B>Use Activated:</B> This type of item simply has to be used in order to activate it. A character has to
            drink a potion, swing a sword, interpose a shield to deflect a blow in combat, look through a lens, sprinkle
            dust, wear a ring, or don a hat. Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.<br>
            Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Continually functioning items are practically
            always items that one wears. A few must simply be in the character's possession (on his person). However,
            some items made for wearing<I> </I>must still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a
            command word (see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen. The description of an
            item states whether a command word is needed in such a case.<br>
            Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated magic item is either a standard action or not an action
            at all and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an action that
            provokes an attack of opportunity in itself. If the use of the item takes time before a magical effect
            occurs, then use activation is a standard action. If the item's activation is subsumed in its use and takes
            no extra time use activation is not an action at all.<br>
            Use activation doesn't mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know
            (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it, unless the benefit
            of the item comes automatically, such from drinking a potion or swinging a sword.<br>
            <br>
            SIZE AND MAGIC ITEMS<br>
            When an article of magic clothing or jewelry is discovered, most of the time size shouldn't be an issue.
            Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they adjust themselves magically to the wearer.
            Size should not keep characters of various kinds from using magic items.<br>
            There may be rare exceptions, especially with racial specific items. <br>
            <B>Armor and Weapon Sizes: </B>Armor and weapons that are found at random have a 30% chance of being Small
            (01&#150;30), a 60% chance of being Medium (31&#150;90), and a 10% chance of being any other size
            (91&#150;100).<br>
            <br>
            MAGIC ITEMS ON THE BODY<br>
            Many magic items need to be donned by a character who wants to employ them or benefit from their abilities.
            It's possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as twelve magic items at the same
            time. However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body.<br>
            A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of one item from each of the following
            groups, keyed to which place on the body the item is worn.<br>
            &#149; One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the head<br>
            &#149; One pair of eye lenses or goggles on or over the eyes<br>
            &#149; One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab around the neck<br>
            &#149; One vest, vestment, or shirt on the torso<br>
            &#149; One robe or suit of armor on the body (over a vest, vestment, or shirt)<br>
            &#149; One belt around the waist (over a robe or suit of armor)<br>
            &#149; One cloak, cape, or mantle around the shoulders (over a robe or suit of armor)<br>
            &#149; One pair of bracers or bracelets on the arms or wrists<br>
            &#149; One glove, pair of gloves, or pair of gauntlets on the hands<br>
            &#149; One ring on each hand (or two rings on one hand)<br>
            &#149; One pair of boots or shoes on the feet<br>
            Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes. However, additional
            items beyond those listed above have no effect. <br>
            Some items<I> </I>can be worn or carried without taking up space on a character's body. The description of
            an item indicates when an item has this property.<br>
            <br>
            SAVING THROWS AGAINST MAGIC ITEM POWERS<br>
            Magic items produce spells or spell-like effects. For a saving throw against a spell or spell-like effect
            from a magic item, the DC is 10 + the tier of the spell or effect + the ability modifier of the minimum
            ability score needed to cast that level of spell. <br>
            Staffs are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw as if the wielder cast the spell, including
            their skill in any specific spell and all modifiers to save DC. <br>
            Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various effects, particularly when the effect has no exact
            spell equivalent (making its level otherwise difficult to determine quickly).<br>
            <br>
            DAMAGING MAGIC ITEMS<br>
            A magic item doesn't need to make a saving throw unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the
            effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his save. Magic items should always get a saving throw against
            spells that might deal damage to them&#151; even against attacks from which a nonmagical item would normally
            get no chance to save. Magic items use the same saving throw bonus for all saves, no matter what the type
            (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will). A magic item's saving throw bonus equals 2 + one-half its item level (round
            down). The only exceptions to this are intelligent magic items, which make Will saves based on their own
            Wisdom scores.<br>
            Magic items, unless otherwise noted, take damage as nonmagical items of the same sort. A damaged magic item
            continues to function, but if it is destroyed, all its magical power is lost.<br>
            <br>
            REPAIRING MAGIC ITEMS<br>
            Some magic items take damage over the course of an adventure. It costs no more to repair a magic item with
            the Craft skill than it does to repair its nonmagical counterpart. The <I>make whole </I>spell also repairs
            a damaged&#151;but not completely broken&#151;magic item.<br>
            <br>
            INTELLIGENT ITEMS<br>
            Some magic items, particularly weapons, have an intelligence all their own. Only permanent magic items (as
            opposed to those with a single use or those with charges such as Wands or Staffs) can be intelligent. (This
            means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.)<br>
            In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence. <br>
            <br>
            CURSED ITEMS<br>
            Some items are cursed&#151;incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces. Cursed items might be
            particularly dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor flaw, an inconvenient
            requirement, or an unpredictable nature. Randomly generated items are cursed 5% of the time. <br>
            <br>
            <font size="5"><br>
                MAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS<br>
            </font>
            <font size="3">Each general type of magic item gets an overall description, followed by descriptions of
                specific items.<br>
                General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other material. The AC,
                hardness, hit points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some magic items. The AC assumes
                that the item is unattended and includes a &#150;5 penalty for the item's effective Dexterity of 0. If a
                creature holds the item, use the creature's Dexterity modifier in place of the &#150;5 penalty.<br>
                Some individual items, notably those that simply store spells and nothing else, don't get full-blown
                descriptions. Reference the spell's description for details, modified by the form of the item (potion,
                scroll, wand, and so on). Assume that the spell is cast at the minimum level required to cast it<br>
                Items with full descriptions have their powers detailed, and each of the following topics is covered in
                notational form at the end of the description.<br>
                &#149; Aura: Most of the time, a <I>detect magic </I>spell will reveal the school of magic associated
                with a magic item and the strength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is
                given at the beginning of the item's notational entry. See the <I>detect magic </I>spell description<I>
                </I>for details.<br>
                <I>&#149; </I>Item Level: The next item in a notational entry gives the level of the item, indicating
                its relative power. The item level determines the item's saving throw bonus, as well as range or other
                level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable). It also determines the level that must
                be contended with should the item come under the effect of a <I>dispel magic </I>spell or similar
                situation. This information is given in the form &#147;IL x,&#148; where &#147;IL&#148; is an
                abbreviation for item level and &#147;x&#148; is an ordinal number representing the item level
                itself.<br>
                For potions, scrolls, and wands, the creator can set the item level of an item at any number high enough
                to cast the stored spell and not higher than her own skill rank for the specific spell being casted. For
                other magic items, the item level is determined by the item itself. In this case, the creator's must be
                able to match the item level when performing craft checks, and prerequisites may effectively put a
                higher minimum on the creator's skill rank.<br>
                &#149; Prerequisites: Certain requirements must be met in order for a character to create a magic item.
                These include feats, spells, and miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and race or kind.
                The prerequisites for creation of an item are given immediately following the item's level.<br>
                A spell prerequisite may be provided by a character who has prepared the spell (or who knows the spell,
                in the case of a sorcerer or bard), or through the use of a spell completion or spell trigger magic item
                or a spell-like ability that produces the desired spell effect. For each day that passes in the creation
                process, the creator must expend one spell completion item or one charge from a spell trigger item if
                either of those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.<br>
                It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each
                participant providing one or more of the prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be
                necessary.<br>
                If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be
                considered the creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator's level must be known. The
                character designated as the creator pays the XP required to make the item.<br>
                Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one or more spells (or some other requirement
                in addition to the feat).<br>
                When two spells at the end of a list are separated by &#147;or,&#148; one of those spells is required in
                addition to every other spell mentioned prior to the last two.<br>
                &#149; Market Price: This gold piece value, given following the word &#147;Price,&#148; represents the
                price someone should expect to pay to buy the item. The market price for an item that can be constructed
                with an item creation feat is usually equal to the base price plus the price for any components
                (material or XP).<br>
                &#149; Cost to Create: The next part of a notational entry is the cost in gp and XP to create the item,
                given following the word<br>
                &#147;Cost.&#148; This information appears only for items with components (material or XP), which make
                their market prices higher than their base prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from
                the base cost plus the costs of the components.<br>
                Items without components do not have a &#147;Cost&#148; entry. For them, the market price and the base
                price are the same. The cost in gp is 1/2 the market price, and the cost in XP is 1/25 the market
                price.<br>
                &#149; Weight: The notational entry for many wondrous items ends with a value for the item's weight.
                When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining how
                much of a load a character can carry).<br>

                CREATING MAGIC ITEMS<br>
            </font>
            <font size="3">To create magic items, spellcasters use special feats. They invest time and money in an
                item's creation.<br>
                At the end of this process, the spellcaster must make a single Spellcraft check to finish the item. The
                DC to create a magic item is 5 + the item level. Failing this check means that the item does not
                function and the materials and time are wasted. Failing this check by 5 or more results in a cursed item
                (see Cursed Items for more information).

                Note that all items have prerequisites in their descriptions. These prerequisites must be met for the
                item to be created. Most of the time, they take the form of spells that must be known by the item's
                creator (although access through another magic item or spellcaster is allowed). The DC to create a magic
                item increases by +5 for each prerequisite the caster does not meet. The only exception to this is the
                requisite item creation feat, which is mandatory. In addition, you cannot create potions, spell-trigger,
                or spell-completion magic items without meeting their spell prerequisites.

                ITEM CREATION FEATS<br>
                An item creation feat lets you create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items
                they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.<br>
                <B>Raw Materials Cost:</B> The cost of creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the
                item.<br>
                Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and
                so on. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply.<br>
                <B>Time:</B> The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum
                time is one day.<br>
                <B>Item Cost:</B> Brew Potion, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell
                effects, and the power of these items depends on their level&#151; which is equal to twice the spell
                level - 1. The price of these items (and thus the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the item
                level. To find the final price in each case, multiply twice the spell tier - 1 by a constant, as shown
                below:<br>
                <I>Scrolls: </I>Base price = (2 x spell tier - 1) x 25 gp.<br>
                <I>Potions: </I>Base price = (2 x spell tier - 1) x 50 gp.<br>
                <I>Wands: </I>Base price = (2 x spell tier - 1) x 750 gp.<br>
                A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell tier of 3/4 for the purpose of this calculation,
                resulting in a base price equal to half that of a 1st level spell.<br>
                <B>Extra Costs: </B>Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component
                also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material
                component or pay the XP cost when creating the item.<br>
                For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component.<br>
                Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components, as noted in their descriptions.<br>

                Note that all items have prerequisites in their descriptions. These prerequisites must be met for the
                item to be created. Most of the time, they take the form of spells that must be known by the item's
                creator (although access through another magic item or spellcaster is allowed).<br>
                While item creation costs are handled in detail below, note that normally the two primary factors are
                the item level and the tier of the spell or spells put into the item. A creator can create an item at
                any level higher the minimum item level.<br>
                Magic supplies for items are always half of the base price in gp. For many items, the market price
                equals the base price.<br>
                Armor, shields, weapons, and items with a value independent of their magically enhanced properties add
                their item cost to the market price. The item cost does not influence the base price (which determines
                the cost of magic supplies and the experience point cost), but it does increase the final market
                price.<br>
                In addition, some items cast or replicate spells with costly material components. For these items, the
                market price equals the base price plus an extra price for the spell component costs. The cost to create
                these items is the magic supplies cost (determined by the base price) plus the costs for the components.
                Descriptions of these items include an entry that gives the total cost of creating the item.<br>
                The creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well-lit place in which to work. Any place
                suitable for preparing spells is suitable for making items. Creating an item requires one day per 1,000
                gp in the item's base price, with a minimum of at least one day. Potions are an exception to this rule;
                they always take just one day to brew. The character must spend the gold at the beginning of the
                construction process.<br>
                The caster works for 8 hours each day. He cannot rush the process by working longer each day. But the
                days need not be consecutive, and the caster can use the rest of his time as he sees fit.<br>
                A character can work on only one item at a time. If a character starts work on a new item, all materials
                used on the under-construction item are wasted.<br>
                The secrets of creating artifacts are long lost.<br>

    MAGIC ITEM GOLD PIECE VALUES<br>
    Many factors must be considered when determining the price of new magic items. The easiest way to come up with a
    price is to match the new item to an item that is already priced that price as a guide. Otherwise, use the
    guidelines summarized on Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values.<br>
    <B>Multiple Similar Abilities: </B>For items with multiple similar abilities that don't take up space on a
    character's body use the following formula: Calculate the price of the single most costly ability, then add 75% of
    the value of the next most costly ability, plus one-half the value of any other abilities.<br>
    <B>Multiple Different Abilities: </B>Abilities such as an attack roll bonus or saving throw bonus and a spell-like
    function are not similar, and their values are simply added together to determine the cost. For items that do take
    up a space on a character's body each additional power not only has no discount but instead has a 50% increase in
    price.<br>
    <B>0-Level Spells: </B>When multiplying spell tiers to determine value, 0-tier spells should be treated as 1/2
    level.<br>
    <B>Other Considerations: </B>Once you have a final cost figure, reduce that number if either of the following
    conditions applies:<br>
    &#151;<I>Item Requires Skill to Use: </I>Some items require a specific skill to get them to function. This factor
    should reduce the cost about 10%.<br>
    &#151;<I>Item Requires Specific Class or Alignment to Use: </I>Even more restrictive than requiring a skill, this
    limitation cuts the cost by 30%.<br>
    Prices presented in the magic item descriptions (the gold piece value following the item's level) are the market
    value, which is generally twice what it costs the creator to make the item.<br>
    Since different classes get access to certain spells at different levels, the prices for two characters to make the
    same item might actually be different. An item is only worth two times what the caster of lowest possible level can
    make it for. Calculate the market price based on the lowest possible level caster, no matter who makes the item.<br>
    Not all items adhere to these formulas directly. The reasons for this are several. First and foremost, these few
    formulas aren't enough to truly gauge the exact differences between items. The price of a magic item may be modified
    based on its actual worth. The formulas only provide a starting point. The pricing of scrolls assumes that, whenever
    possible, a wizard or cleric created it. Potions and wands follow the formulas exactly. Staffs follow the formulas
    closely, and other items require at least some judgment calls.<br>
    <br>
    MASTERWORK ITEMS<br>
    Masterwork items are extraordinarily well-made items. They are more expensive, but they benefit the user with
    improved quality. They are not magical in any way. However, only masterwork items may be enhanced to become magic
    armor and weapons. (Items that are not weapons or armor may or may not be masterwork items.)<br>
    <br>
    CREATING MAGIC ARMOR<br>
    To create magic armor, a character needs a heat source and some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. He also needs a
    supply of materials, the most obvious being the armor or the pieces of the armor to be assembled. Armor to be made
    into magic armor must be masterwork armor, and the masterwork cost is added to the base price to determine final
    market value. Additional magic supplies costs for the materials are subsumed in the cost for creating the magic
    armor&#151;half the base price of the item.<br>
    Creating magic armor has a special prerequisite: The creator's Spellcraft skill must be at least four times the
    enhancement bonus of the armor.<br>
    Magic armor or a magic shield must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus to have any of the abilities listed on
    Table: Armor Special Abilities and Table: Shield Special Abilities.<br>
    If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the armor, the creator must provide any material components
    or focuses the spells require. The act of working on the armor triggers the spells, and you need to make successful
    skill checks appropriately.<br>
    Creating some armor may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual
    descriptions for details.<br>
    Crafting magic armor requires one day for each 1,000 gp value of the base price.<br>
    Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Magic Arms and Armor.<br>
    <br>
    CREATING MAGIC WEAPONS<br>
    To create a magic weapon, a character needs a heat source and some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. She also
    needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the weapon or the pieces of the weapon to be assembled. Only a
    masterwork weapon can become a magic weapon, and the masterwork cost is added to the total cost to determine final
    market value. Additional magic supplies costs for the materials are subsumed in the cost for creating the magic
    weapon&#151;half the base price given on Table: Weapons, according to the weapon's total effective bonus.<br>
    A magic weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus to have any of the abilities listed on Table: Melee Weapon
    Special Abilities or Table Ranged Weapon Special Abilities.<br>
    If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the weapon, the creator must have prepared the spells to be
    cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not provide any material components or
    focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of the
    item. The act of working on the weapon triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each
    day of the weapon's creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as
    if they had been cast.)<br>
    At the time of creation, the creator must decide if the weapon glows or not as a side-effect of the magic imbued
    within it. This decision does not affect the price or the creation time, but once the item is finished, the decision
    is binding.<br>
    Creating magic double-headed weapons is treated as creating two weapons when determining cost, time, XP, and special
    abilities.<br>
    Creating some weapons may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual
    descriptions for details.<br>
    Crafting a magic weapon requires one day for each 1,000 gp value of the base price.<br>
    Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Magic Arms and Armor.<br>
    <br>
    CREATING POTIONS<br>
    The creator of a potion needs a level working surface and at least a few containers in which to mix liquids, as well
    as a source of heat to boil the brew. In addition, he needs ingredients. The costs for materials and ingredients are
    subsumed in the cost for brewing the potion&#151;25 gp x (2 x the tier of the spell - 1).<br>
    All ingredients and materials used to brew a potion must be fresh and unused. The character must pay the full cost
    for brewing each potion. (Economies of scale do not apply.)<br>
    The imbiber of the potion is both the caster and the target. Spells with a range of personal cannot be made into
    potions.<br>
    The creator must have prepared the spell to be placed in the potion (or must know the spell, in the case of a
    sorcerer or bard) and must provide any material component or focus the spell requires.<br>
    Material components are consumed when he begins working, but a focus is not. (A focus used in brewing a potion can
    be reused.) The act of brewing triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for casting until the character
    has rested and regained spells. (That is, that spell slot is expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if
    it had been cast.) Brewing a potion requires one day.<br>

        CREATING RINGS<br>
        To create a magic ring, a character needs a heat source. He also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious
        being a ring or the pieces of the ring to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for
        creating the ring. Ring costs are difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece
        Values and use the ring prices in the ring descriptions as a guideline. Creating a ring generally costs half the
        ring's market price.<br>
        Rings that duplicate spells with costly material or XP components add in the value of 50 x the spell's component
        cost. Having a spell with a costly component as a prerequisite does not automatically incur this cost. The act
        of working on the ring triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the
        ring's creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they
        had been cast.)<br>
        Creating some rings may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual
        descriptions for details.<br>
        Forging a ring requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.<br>
        Item Creation Feat Required: Forge Ring.<br>
        <br>
        CREATING RODS<br>
        To create a magic rod, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a rod or the pieces of
        the rod to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the rod. Rod costs are
        difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the rod prices in the
        rod descriptions as a guideline. Creating a rod costs half the market value listed.<br>
        If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the rod, the creator must have prepared the spells to be
        cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not provide any material components
        or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of
        the item. The act of working on the rod triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during
        each day of the rod's creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells,
        just as if they had been cast.)<br>
        Creating some rods may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual

        Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Rod.<br>
        <br>
        CREATING SCROLLS<br>
        To create a scroll, a character needs a supply of choice writing materials, the cost of which is subsumed in the
        cost for scribing the scroll&#151;12.5 gp x (2 x the tier of the spell - 1).<br>
        All writing implements and materials used to scribe a scroll must be fresh and unused. A character must pay the
        full cost for scribing each spell scroll no matter how many times she previously has scribed the same spell.<br>
        The creator must have prepared the spell to be scribed (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or
        bard) and must provide any material component or focus the spell requires. If casting the spell would reduce the
        caster's XP total, she pays the cost upon beginning the scroll in addition to the XP cost for making the scroll
        itself. Likewise, a material component is consumed when she begins writing, but a focus is not. (A focus used in
        scribing a scroll can be reused.) The act of writing triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for
        casting until the character has rested and regained spells. (That is, that spell slot is expended from her
        currently prepared spells, just as if it had been cast.)<br>
        Scribing a scroll requires one day per each 1,000 gp of the base price.<br>

        CREATING STAFFS<br>
        To create a magic staff, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a staff or the pieces
        of the staff to be assembled.<br>
        The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the staff&#151;375 gp x (2 x the level of the
        highest-level spell - 1), plus 75% of the value of the next most costly ability, i.e. 281.25 gp x (2 x the level
        of the highest-level spell - 1), plus one-half of the value of any other abilities, i.e. 187.5 gp (2 x the level
        of the highest-level spell - 1). Staffs are always fully charged (50 charges) when created, and recover 1d6
        charges every day at dawn.<br>
        The creator must know the spells to be stored and must provide any focus the spells require as well as material
        component costs sufficient to activate the spell a maximum number of times (50 divided by the spell tier).
        Material components are consumed when he begins working, but focuses are not. (A focus used in creating a staff
        can be reused.)<br>
        Creating a few staffs may entail other prerequisites beyond spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for
        details.<br>
        Crafting a staff requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.<br>

        <br>
        CREATING WANDS<br>
        To create a magic wand, a character needs a small supply of materials, the most obvious being a baton or the
        pieces of the wand to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the
        wand&#151;375 gp x (2 x the level of the highest-level spell - 1). Wands are always fully charged (25 charges)
        when created, and recover 1d6 charges every day at dawn.<br>
        The creator must know the spell to be stored and must provide any focuses the spell requires. Twentyfive of each
        needed material component are required, one for each charge. Material components are consumed when she begins
        working, but focuses are not. (A focus used in creating a wand can be reused.)<br>
        Crafting a wand requires one day per each 1,000 gp of the base price.<br>

        CREATING WONDROUS ITEMS<br>
        To create a wondrous item, a character usually needs some sort of equipment or tools to work on the item. She
        also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the item to be
        assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the item. Wondrous item costs are
        difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the item prices in the
        item descriptions as a guideline. Creating an item costs half the market value listed.<br>
        If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the item, the creator must have prepared the spells to be
        cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not provide any material components
        or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of
        the item. The act of working on the item triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting
        during each day of the item's creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared
        spells, just as if they had been cast.)<br>
        Creating some items may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual
        descriptions for details.<br>
        Crafting a wondrous item requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.<br>

        <br>
        INTELLIGENT ITEM CREATION<br>
        To create an intelligent item, a character must have a Spellcraft skill score of 15 or higher. Time and creation
        cost are based on the normal item creation rules, with the market price values on Table: Item Intelligence,
        Wisdom, Charisma, and Capabilities treated as additions to time, gp cost. The item's alignment is the same as
        its creator's. Determine other features randomly, following the guidelines in the relevant section.<br>
        <br>
        ADDING NEW ABILITIES<br>
        A creator can add new magical abilities to a magic item with no restrictions. The cost to do this is the same as
        if the item was not magical. Thus, a <I>+1 longsword </I>can be made into a <I>+2 vorpal longsword</I>, with the
        cost to create it being equal to that of a <I>+2 vorpal sword </I>minus the cost of a <I>+1 sword</I>.<br>
        If the item is one that occupies a specific place on a character's body the cost of adding any additional
        ability to that item increases by 50%. For example, if a character adds the power to confer <I>invisibility
        </I>to her <I>ring of protection +2</I>, the cost of adding this ability is the same as for creating a <I>ring
            of invisibility </I>multiplied by 1.5.<br>
        <br>
        BODY SLOT AFFINITIES<br>
        Each location on the body, or body slot, has one or more affinities: a word or phrase that describes the general
        function or nature of magic items designed for that body slot. Body slot affinities are deliberately broad,
        abstract categorizations, because a hard-and-fast rule can't cover the great variety among wondrous items.<br>
        You can use the affinities in the list below to guide your decisions on which magic items should be allowed in
        which body slots. And when you design your own magic items, the affinities give you some guidance for what form
        a particular item should take.<br>
        Some body slots have different affinities for different specific items. <br>
